  "content": "The Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination is only valid for a year, and has a score range 0\u2013400. The\nexamination is a test of knowledge, speed and accuracy. It consists of 180 questions with a time frame of\n2 hours (120 minutes). The subject combination[10] vary based on a candidate's desired course of study,\nalthough English language is compulsory for all candidates.\nThe examination is conducted for international candidates who wish to be admitted into any Nigerian\ntertiary institution by the West African Examination Council (WAEC).\nAfter the conduct of the year's examination, the board sits and deliberates on the cut-off mark for\nuniversities, polytechnics, colleges of education and 'monotechniques'. Often universities have the higher\ncut-off mark, while other institutions require lower marks.[11]\nIn 2024 Jamb reduced it's cut off mark to 140 for private and public universities and 100 for polytechnics\nand colleges of education.[12][13][14]\nJamb gives admission to students whose school of choice has already confirmed as fit and qualified for\nadmission. The only thing JAMB does is to confirm the admission and upload it on their portal then issue\nout JAMB admission letters to the candidates.\nThe Joint Admission and Matriculation Board is yet to officially approve a certified CBT practice\nplatform for candidates. However, with growing concern over the performance of candidates in these\ncomputer-based tests,[15] considering the fact that Nigeria is a developing country with a sizeable number\nof school children having little to no access to computers & the internet,[16] a number of independent\ncontributors [17] have provided practice platforms with thousands of past questions to help candidates\nprepare and boost their performance in the actual test.[18]\nIshaq Oloyede, current registrar (highest-ranking official)\n1. \"Ojerinde re-appointed JAMB registrar\" (http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/04/ojerinde-re-a\nppointed-jamb-registrar/).
