Ripples on water and light waves are similar \nbecause both \nA. have the same frequency \nB. can be refracted and diffracted \nC. are longitudinal waves \nD. have the same velocity. \n \n29. Under constant tension and constant mass per \nunit length, the note produced by a plucked string \nis 500 Hz when the length of the string is 0.90 m. At \nwhat length is the frequency 150 Hz? \nA. 3m B. 4m \nC. 5m D. 6m \n \n30. The colours seen in thin films of oil on the road \nand in soap bubbles are due to \nA. Reflection B. Interference \nC.

The two waves \nwill interfere \nA. destructively to produce a wave of a \nlarger amplitude \nB. destructively to produce a wave of a \nsmaller amplitude \nC. constructively to produce a wave of a \nlarger amplitude \nD. constructively to produce a wave of a \nsmaller amplitude. \n \n32. If the load at the end of a sonometer wire is \nimmersed in a bucket of water, the original \nfundamental frequency of the wire could be \nrestored by \nA. decreasing the length of the wire \nB. increasing the length of the wire \nC. increasing the mass per unit of the wire \nD. changing the temperature of the water. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nX \n \n \nWhen the sun, the moon and the earth are as \nshown in the diagram above, an observer \nstanding at X is in \nA. penumbra and sees a partial eclipse \nB. penumbra and sees a total eclipse \nC. umbra and sees a partial eclipse \nD. umbra and sees a total eclipse. \n \n34.
