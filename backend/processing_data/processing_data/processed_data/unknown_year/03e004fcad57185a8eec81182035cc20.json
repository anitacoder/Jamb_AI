  "content": "has learned to verbalize certain range of meanings in his home \nand when he enters school, another range of meanings is \nrequired. There is, then a very subtle, but nonetheless very real, \nsense in which what is taught is personally irrelevant for this \nchild. The school system does not talk to him. Middle class \nchildren, possessing both codes, experience no such \ndiscontinuity. They can use language for those functions \nrequired by the school. \n \n16. An appropriate title for this passage is \nA. Language and Education B. Education and Sociology \nC.  Codes and Sociology D. Codes and Education \n \n17. The groups of children mentioned as examples in the \npassage are \nA. rural and urban working-class and middle-class \nB. urban working-class and rural middle-class \nC. urban working-class and rural and urban middle-class \nD. urban middle class and rural and urban working- \nclass. \n \n18. \u2018Restricted code\u2019 and \u2018elaborated code\u2019 are \nA. synonyms B. homonyms C. contradictions D. antonyms \n \n19. It can be assumed reasonably that language has \nA. only one code \nB. two codes \nC. three codes, two used for education \nD. more than three codes, but only two used for education. \n \n20. \u2018The school system does not talk to him\u2019 means  that the \nA. teachers do not talk to him \nB. teachers talk to him differently from the way \nother pupils do \nC. headmaster and teachers do not talk to him \nD. teachers talk to him differently from the way \nhe is talked to at home. \n \n \nPASSAGE V \nThis passage sums up the two problems peculiar to the \nbook trade which make it different from any other trade \u2013 the \nproblem of selection and the problem of stocking. How is the \nbookseller to tell what, in an enormous output, will prove saleable, \nbefore the full weight of unsold items affects the balance of his \nbusiness, and how is he, at the same time, to hold a stock large \nenough to enable the public to choose freely? He may seek to \nescape from this dilemma by becoming the passive sales \nrepresentative of large publishing houses or distribution \nnetworks, but he is then no longer a book seller. He may take \nrefuge in the sale of safe items to a restricted circle of customers, \nbut he thereby cuts himself off from all that is vital in his trade \nand dooms himself to mediocrity and stagnation. On the other \nhand, he may protect his business from the danger of idle stock \nby speculating on the latest publications, but this is a dangerous \ngame in that it implies a constantly changing clientele: readers \nremain faithful to their own discoveries and failure to follow up \na book, an author or a type of literature means dismissing the \npublic responsible for their success. \nThis brings us back to the fact that books are \nundefinable. The story is told of a certain country with a great \nmany generals where it was decided to present a rare and valuable \nedition of an old book to a general about to retire. The old \nsoldier looked at the volume and remarked, \u2018A book? What\u2019s the \npoint? I\u2019ve already got one!\u2019 \n \n21. Books are different from other goods because \nA. customers for the book trade are much restricted \nB. books are not manufactured but printed \nC. one cannot tell so easily which books will \nprove saleable \nD. books can be kept in stock much longer than \nother goods. \n22. The problem of selection in the book trade involves \nA. holding a stock large enough for the public to \nchoose from \nB. determining which books will sell fast \nC. being a sales representative of large publishing houses \nD. being able to review the latest publications. \n \n23. How many solutions to the bookseller\u2019s problems are \noffered in this passage? \nA. Two B.  Three C.  Four D. Five \n24. Of the solutions proposed for the bookseller\u2019s \nproblems, how many are actually positive? \nA. Two B. Three C. Four D. None. \n25. The story of the old soldier and a book in the passage \nis an illustration of the point that \nA. the general had already got a book \nB. a book is of interest only to those to whom \nthat book means something \nC. soldiers do not like the book trade because a \nbook is enough for a general \nD. booksellers face a real dilemma because of a \nconstantly changing clientele. \nLEXISAND STRUCTURE \nIn each of questions 26 to 36, choose the option opposite in \nmeaning to the word in italics. \n26.
