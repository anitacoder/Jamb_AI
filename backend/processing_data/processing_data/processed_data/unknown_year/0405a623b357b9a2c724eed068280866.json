  "content": "But today, the situation is different. Theatre is becoming very \nunpopular. \nAfrica of the present age is pre -occupied with many \nproblems yearning for immediate solutions. The continent is \nfacing hydra-headed challenges --- challenges on the political, \nsocial and economic scenes. In a world where science and \ntechnology are seen as the solutions to these problems, little \nattention is paid to the arts. Literature generally, and drama in \nparticular, is often rated very low on the utility scale. Many in \nAfrica today look at drama and theatre as a mere thing of fun, a \njoke so to say. \nElitism is another barrier that militates against the \nappreciation of theatre as a communal art. Folk theatre is \nappreciated by a negligible number of people. Contemporary \nfocus is on literary theatre. Unfortunately. Literary theatre only \npretends to serve the interest of its society while in reality it has \na foreign audience in mind. The use of Europeans and American \ntheatrical conventions by our academic playwrights can bear \nwitness to this anomaly. \nThe popularity of the literary African theatre is further \nmarred by the medium of communication as most literary dramas \nin Africa are written in foreign languages , which are not \nunderstood by many Africans. The question often asked is \nwhether the artist should climb down to the level of his \ncommunity or stay at his exalted height and wait for the \ncommunity to gradually move up to him. \n \n6. Theatre was popular in Africa because it \nA. was traditional and simple in nature \nB. dealt with the political, social and economic \nproblem of the society \nC. was a source of fun \nD. was communal and reflected the common \nconcerns of the people. \n \n7. One of the reasons why theatre is unpopular in modern \nAfrica is that it \nA. is regarded as not being of much use \nB. only deals with cultural and tradition \nC. lacks scientific and academic bases \nD. is always funny and looked down upon. \n \n8. In the passage the terms \u2018theatre\u2019 and \u2018drama\u2019 are used \nA. differently B. concurrently C. interchangeable \nD. sparingly. \n \n9. One of the arguments in the passage is that academic \nplaywrights \nA. express themselves only in foreign languages \nB. serve as a catalyst in the society\u2019s appreciation \nof theatre \nC. work against the common man\u2019s appreciation \nof theatre \nD. make theatre popular in traditional societies. \n \n10. By the expression \u2018climb down\u2019, the author implies that \nmodern playwrights should \nA. be simplistic in the use if language \nB. not move on \nC. use language that is most appreciated by the people \nD. wait for the community to catch up with them \nPASSAGE III \nThe financing of the university will always be a \nvexatious problem not only because of the need for it to maintain \na level of independence that allows for the thriving of intellectual \npursuit but also for the size of funding that is required to maintain \nan acceptable level of infrastructure in a modern university. The \nexperience of the Nigerian university in recent years has in this \nregard, been almost alarming. The funding level required \nconstitute sufficient reasons for diversifying the sources. Even \nif government was in a position on its own to meet all of the \nuniversity\u2019s financial requirements. I consider it desirable that \nevery effort be made to reduce such contribution in the interest \nof university autonomy. I also hold the view that the university \nshould seek to become dependent, in a substantial way, on funds \ngenerated from within. In other words the sources of funding \nthe university should be diversified as much as possible. Based \non this principle, we can identify four sources \u2014 government, \nindustry, students and individual philanthropists. I must add \nquickly that each source has its own set of problems in its \ncontinuing interaction with the university, which ought to be \naddressed here. \nOf all the four major sources of financing university \neducation mentioned above, contribution through fees from the \nstud ents involves instricate issues of special concern, if \ngovernment gives as an expression of its obligation to promote \ngeneral welfare of society, if industry gives in order to enhance \nits chances of procurement of needed human, information and \nmaterial resources, as well as enhance its social responsibility. If \nthe general public gives as an indication of voluntary support \nfor a worthy social cause, students (and by inference their \nparents) should give in order to purchase an economic good for \nmeeting their own felt need in the expectation that they will be \nsatisfied with the product purchased. \n[Adapted from Onosode, G. O. :\u2018The Politics of Managing People Prospects \nand Poverty The Role of the University\u2019, 1009 OAU Convocation] \n \n11. It is important for Universities to be independent so \nthat they can \nA. attract funds from industries \nB. determine their goals \nC. be left to expand without any hindrance \nD. carry out effective research. \n \n12. The writer advocates for multiple sources of university \nfunding in order to \nA. enhance university autonomy \nB. reduce dependence on government \nC. ensure that the numerous needs of the \nuniversities are met \nD. maintain acceptable levels of infrastructural \ndevelopment. \n \n13. The expression \u2018intricate issues of special concern\u2019 \nmeans \nA. important policy statements \nB. interwoven topics of significance \nC. complex matters requiring careful thought \nD. knotty problems that  concern everybody. \n \n14. The word \u2018diversified\u2019 as used in the passage means A. \ndifferentiated B. varied   C. diffused D. widened. \n \n15. The source of university funding emphasized in the \npassage is",
