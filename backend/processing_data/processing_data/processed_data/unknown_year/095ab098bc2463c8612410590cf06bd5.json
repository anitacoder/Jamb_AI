They \nalso kill elephants, not for food but for spear blooding, or to \nprove their manhood. When elephants are located, there is \ngreat excitement and fierce competition among the young men. \nEach tries to be the first to blood his spear: the one who does so, \nclaims the trophy. No young man is looked upon with favour by \nthe girls until he has won his spurs by killing a dangerous animal. \nBut brave as the Emopa are, two fierce man-eaters completely \noverawed them. This was partly due to the cunning and \nboldness of the lions, partly to the fact that, when hunted, \nthey would always retreat into dense riverine undergrowth, where \nit was impossible for a man to poise and throw a spear. Super- \nstitution had also added its quota to the fear with which they \nwere regarded. It was said that before starting off on a raid the \nlions would retire to an open sandy place and there make two \nrows of depressions in the sand with their paws. Then, using \ntwigs as counters, they would play the ancient game of \u2018baw\u2019 (a \ngame of unknown antiquity, which resembles draughts and is \nplayed all over Africa). If the omens were good they would raid \na village and claim a victim; if not, they would wait. Another \nstory had it that the lions were the spirits of two \u2018holy men\u2019 who \nhad now come back in this shape to seek their revenge. So \nstrongly was this view held that the local Emopa had petitioned \na practicing \u2018holy man\u2019 to come from a great distance to exorcise \nthe spirits. He came with book, bell and candle and charged a \nfee of a hundred goats, but the lions  continued  their  \ndepredations. To add to the legend of the lions\u2019 invulnerability \nmany famous hunters had tried on previous occasions to kill \nthem and had failed owing to lack of time. This confirmed the \nEmopa\u2019s opinion that the lions were supernatural beings and \nthat it was useless to hunt them. \n1. The young men of Emopa would hunt for elephants because \nA. they are among the fewAfricans that hunt lions \nwith a spear \nB. elephants are dangerous animals \nC. no young Emopa attracts a girl\u2019s admiration \nuntil he has killed a dangerous animal \nD. when elephants aresighted, thereis great excitement \nand fierce competition among the young men. \n \n2. The legend that the lions were invulnerable was \nconfirmed by the fact that \nA. the local Emopa petitioned a \u2018holy man\u2019 to \ncome and exorcize the spirits \nB. many famous hunters had tried without \nsuccess in the past to kill the lions \nC. the\u2018holyman\u2019 failed in his bid toexorcise thespirits \nD. brave as the Emopa are, the lions completely \noverawed them. \n \n3. The lions played the game of \u2018baw\u2019 because \nA. they wanted to raid a village \nB. it was a popular game of unknown antiquity \nplayed all over Africa \nC. they want to decide whether to go on a raid or not \nD. if the omens were good they would raid a \nvillage and claim a victim. \n \n4. The famous hunters failed to kill the lions because the \nA. lions were regarded as supernatural beings \nB. lions were cunning and bold \nC. Emopa used the spear to hunt for the lions \nD. hunters did not have enough time. \n \n5. According to the passage, which of the following is \nNOT a superstitious reason for fearing the lions? \nA. Many famous hunters had tried and failed to kill \nthe lions \nB. The lions were bold and when hunted, they would \nretreat to where a spear could not be thrown at them. \nC.  The lions were the spirits of two \u2018holy men\u2019 who \ncame back to seek their revenge. \nD.  The lions played the ancient game of \u2018baw\u2019 before \nstarting on a raid to determine whether to proceed \nor wait.",
