You \nneed skill in deciding how to make the most advantageous use \nof the figures that turn up on the die when you cast it. Since \neach player has at least four alternative ways of using his figures, \ntwo players with equal luck may fare differently, depending on \nhow cleverly each one uses his figures. The element of luck, \nagain as in human life, plays a dominant role however. For no \nmatter how skilful a player may be in using the figures he gets on \nthe die, he has a slim chance of winning if he continually throws \nlow figures. While a combination of ones and twos may be \nuseful in checking the advance of one\u2019s opponents, it will not \ntake one home fast enough to win. On the other hand, consistent \nthrows of sixes and fives, with even the very minimum of skill, \nwill help a player to home all his four counters before any of the \nthree other players, unless, of course, he has no idea of the \ngame at all. \n \n11. According to the passage, Ludo is \nA. more a game of skill than of chance \nB. more a game of luck that of skill \nC. equally a game of chance and skill \nD. a game entirely of luck. \n \n12. It is implied in the passage that two players may fare \nequally if they \nA. have equal luck \nB. apply similar skill to figures \nC. apply similar skill to similar figures \nD. have equal skill. \n \n13.

In the passage, the possession of skill specifically \nenables a player to \nA. win \nB. throw good figures \nC. use his figures efficiently \nD. check his opponents efficienctly \nPASSAGE IV \nFarming is the most important aspect of agriculture that \nhas attracted attention within the last few years. Agriculture \nhas several other aspects like fishery, livestock and poultry. All \nthese are also important in that they have to do with the \nproduction of food items which human beings consume for \nsurvival. \nIn many parts of the world today, farming has been \nregarded as the mainstay of the economy. Crops such as cocoa, \nrubber and cotton have been produced in such  commercial \nquantity that they are sold to other countries. Some countries \nhave better comparative advantage in producing certain farm \ncrops than other countries. In these other countries, there is the \nneed to spend a lot of money on agriculture, particularly farming. \nplace to store their crops, most of which are always destroyed \nby insects and pests before harvest time. All these have adverse \neffects on their productivity. \nThe government can do a lot to help farmers. farmers\u2019 \nco-operative societies can be encouraged and loans can be made \navailable to farmers through government institutions, like banks \nand finance corporation. Farmers can be taught how to build \ngood storage structures for their produce. All these and a lot \nmore can help to improve the conditions of farming in these \ncountries. \n \n16. The most important aspect of agriculture mentioned in \nthe passage is \nA. poultry    B.   fishery   C.   livestock D. farming. \n \n17. Farming in many countries today is \nA. an alternative to poultry \nB. of great assistance to the economy \nC. for those who are out of jobs \nD. for the illiterates. \n \n18. Some countries produce more and better crops than \nothers because the farmers in the former \nA. are more educated \nB. have greater manpower \nC. have more modern equipment \nD. have more fertile land. \n \n19. In order to help improve the state of farming, the \ngovernment should \nA. give all farmers enough money to work with \nB. sell enough fertilizers to all farmers \nC. find ways of financing and modernizing the \nfarming system \nD. help farmers with the storage of their crops. \n \n20. A lot of crops harvested are wasted because farmers \nA. allow insects and  pests to destroy their crops \nB. do not have enough money to invest in harvesters \nC. do not have good storage facilities \nD. harvest too much at a time. \n \nPASSAGE V \nIt may be argued that museums as an institution and an \nagency for transmitting cultural heritage are an artificial creation, \nso far as objects are removed from their natural or proper \nenvironments and put into museums which are a different \nenvironment altogether. However, it seems that museums \nthemselves have come to be accepted and recognized as the \nbest equipped institutions devised by man for the assemblage \nof cultural objects and their presentation and preservation for \nthe present and future generations. \nThe artificial character of museums is however being \ngradually transformed into a cultural reality. Thus, just as one \ngoes to the theatre for plays and other performing arts, the \nmosque, the church or the shrine for worship, the library for the \nprinted words, today, it is to the museum one goes to see evidence \nof man\u2019s material outfit. For, no other institution or place so \nreadily comes to mind as museums do when evidence of material \nculture is sought. Herein lies the importance of museums as \ncultural institutions and an agency for transmitting culture. \n \n21. Museums are at artificial creation because",
