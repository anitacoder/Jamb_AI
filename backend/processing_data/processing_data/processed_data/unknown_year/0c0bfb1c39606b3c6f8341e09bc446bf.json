Each Question carries 3 marks. \n \nPASSAGE I \n \nIf, once in a lifetime, you see a blue moon , don\u2019t think \nyour eyes are playing tricks on you. It\u2019s caused by dust in our \nupper atmosphere; ice crystals are what make you see rings \nround the moon. \nOver the centuries, magical powers have been attributed \nto the moon . It has been said to bring on lunacy, affect the \ngrowth of plants, eyes of cats, spots of panthers, functions of \nwomen and activities of ghosts. France once had a law against \ncutting timber except during a waning moon. The moon, and to \n \n \n \na lesser degree the sun, does cause the ocean tides because of \ntheir gravitational pull. But a common mistake of primitive people \nis to think that everything timed in the same rhythm as the moon \nis caused by it. \nAll the moon gazing, probing and measuring has never \nsolved the big problem: its origin. One theory is that it began as \na planet, got too near the more massive earth, was \u2018captured\u2019 \nand turned into a satellite. Another is that the latter theory is \ntrue, scientists say, there would be two clues: the moon would \nconsist of lighter material than the earth, and the earth would be \nleft with a scar. As a matter of fact, the moon does weigh less. \nAnd the Pacific Ocean does have a scarlike bottom of basaltic \nrocks instead of the granite rocks usually found near the earth\u2019s \nsurface. \nBut the assumption that, if man can get to the moon, he\u2019ll \nfind the answer is unfounded. Man has been on the earth \nhundreds of thousands of years without determining the earth\u2019s \norigin. Scientists, of course, will never give up either quest. \nIndeed, for thousands of years the moon has worked a \nspell of fascination over all the people on its near neighbour, \nthe earth. The ancient worshipped this lamp in the sky and \nspeculated about it endlessly. Modern astronomers continue to \nexplore its mysteries almost every night of the year, and with \nreason. \nAges ago , before artificial light was known, it was \nimportant as illumination at night. As everyone knows, the moon \nhas no light of its own; it shines with the cold reflection of the \ndistant sun, but actually the moon is a poor satellite with \u2018earth \nlight\u2019 sixty times as bright as the best moonlight. That\u2019s why we \nsometimes see the whole moon faintly when the sun is lighting \nup only a narrow crescent. \n \n1. The phrase near neighbour, as used in the passage, shows \nthat \nA. moonlight generally shares many characteristics \nwith \u2018earth light\u2019 \nB. the earth is nearer to the moon than to the sun \nC. theearth actuallysharesboundaries with themoon. \nD. Moonlight shines brighter on the earth\u2019s \nsurface than perhaps elsewhere. \nA. rare phenomenon \nB. regular event \nC. trick of the moon \nD. life-long opportunity \n \n3. The sentence over the centuries, magical powers have \nbeen attributed to the moon suggests that \nA. people perform magic with the moon \nB. it is a common belief that the moon has magical \npowers \nC. the moon actually possesses magical powers. \nD. The moon reflects magical powers from the sun\u2019s \nrays. \n \n4. The expression either quest refers to the origin of \nA. the moon or the earth \nB. neither the moon nor the earth \nC. the moon \nD. the earth. \n \n5. A suitable title for the passage is \nA. The Magical Powers of the Moon \nB. Facts about the Moon \nC. The Lunar Cycle \nD. Moon-Gazing. \n \nPASSAGE II \n \nThe passage below has gaps numbered 6 to 15. Immediately \nfollowing each gap, four options are provided. Choose the most \nappropriate option for each gap. Each question carries 2 marks. \n \nCapitalism is an economic system which is founded on \nthe principle of free enterprise and the private ownership of the \nmeans of production and distribution.
