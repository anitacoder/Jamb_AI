Our environment is under threat. \nThe air we breathe, the water we drink, the seas we fish in, the \nsoil we farm, the forest, animals and plants which surround us \nare in danger. New terms and words describe these problems \u2013 \nacid rain, the greenhouse effect, global warming, holes in the \nozone layer, desertification and industrial pollution. We are \nchanging our environment. More and more gases and wastes \nescape from our factories. Rubbish, oil spillages and detergents \ndamage our rivers and seas. Forests give us timber and paper, \nbut there loss results in soil erosion and also endangers wildlife. \nThe richer countires of the world are mainly responsible \nfor industrial pollution. This is where most of all the commercial \nenergy is produced. In developing countries, poverty causes \npeople to change their environment \u2013 to overgraze grasslands, \nto cut down trees for new land and firewood, to farm poor soil \nfor food. \nThe United Nations Environmental Protection Agency \nsays that an area of forest the size of Sierra Leone disappears \nevery year. Trees are cut down for timber which is used for \nbuilding, furniture, paper and fuel. They are also destroyed to \nprovide land on which to graze animals and build new villages \nand towns. But trees have many other important uses. Trees \nprotect the land from heavy downpour of rain and their roots \nhelp to hold the soil together. Forests are also the home of many \nliving things. The amazon forest contains one fifth of all the \nspecies of birds in the world. In our forest, there may be plants \nand animals which could help in the discovery of new medicines \nor crops. \nTo rescue and converse our beautiful world, we must act \ncooperatively. Individuals, communities, nations and \ninternational associations, all have a responsibility. By learning \nto protect the natural environment, we can manage the earth\u2019s \nresources for generations to come. \n \n1. The risk referred to in the passage is \nA. environmentally induced \nB. industrially produced \nC. man-made \nD. sociologically produced. \n \n2. From the passage, it can be deduced that the inhabitants \nof developing countries \nA. take more care of their environment than those \nin  developed countries \nB. generate more harmful industrial by-products \nC. degrade the environment to eke out a \nlivelihood  D. cut down trees only  for \nfarmlands and fuel. \n \n3.  According to the passage, the size of forest depleted \nannually is \nA. minimal B. colossal C. infinitesimal D. infinite. \n \n4. The writer holds the richer countries responsible for \nindustrial pollution because of their \nA. technological innovations \nB. energy requirements \nC. industrial revolution \nD. lack of interest in environmental protection. \n5. The message of the writer is the \nA. need for the developed countries to assist the \npoorer ones \nB. grave dangers of global warming \nC. urgent need to protect the natural environment \nD. need to research into other uses of the trees \nin  our forests. \nPASSAGE II \nIf economists were a bit more modest, they would admit \nthat no one knows exactly how many Nigerians there are. The \nNational Population Bureau estimated that there would be 116 \nmillion in 1986, but this figure was derived from projections based \non the much disputed figures of the 1963 census, using an annual",
