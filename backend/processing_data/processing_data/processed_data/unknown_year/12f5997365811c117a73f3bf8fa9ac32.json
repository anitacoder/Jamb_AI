  "content": "predicament. All that notwithstanding, I learnt from that incident \nan indelible lesson which was to stand me in very good stead \nthroughout my stay in the university: namely, the importance of \nreading notice boards and handbills if one is to be well informed \nabout places and events in the university. \n \n1. The write of the passage felt isolated because \nA. there were too many people \nB. he was a new student in freedom university \nC. there were too many new students \nD. none of the many people around could help him. \n \n2. The write says that the prospect was not cheerful because \nA. no one could tell him how to get to Grant Hall \nB. he had felt too elated when he gained admission \ninto the university \nC. there was no hope of getting out of his predicament \nD. the other students were hostile. \n \n3. In the passage, the darkness of ignorance refers to the \nA. state of the writer before he found the notice board \nB. ignorance of illiterates \nC. ignorance of those who have not been to university \nD. fact that he was a freshman. \n \n4. According to the passage the writers predicament was \ncaused by \nA. the writer himself \nB. those who displayed the notices and perhaps the writer \nC. the nature of the notice board and where it was placed \nD. those who displayed the notices. \n \n5. The writer remembered his first day in the university for \na long time because he \nA. had felt very happy at being admitted into the \nuniversity  \nB. could not get anybody to help him on his first \nday in the university \nC. had learnt the hard way how to keep informed \nabout happenings in the university \nD. eventually discovered the notice board by chance. \n \n \nPASSAGE II \nTo listen properly is hard job, and probably one of the \ntoughest skills in the art of communication. Good listening has \nnothing to do with proper functioning of one\u2019s auditory organs, \nwhich is assumed to be inevitable. Good listening in the sense \nwe are interested in, is not a biological factor, but a psychological \none. Your auditory organs maybe in perfect order, when actually, \nyou cannot use them creatively. Creative listening implies your \nbeing efficient, in the art of concentration, in other words, you \nconcentrate on what one is saying so as to make sure that you \nhear all that is said. At the same time you are concentrating to \nhear all that is being said, you are also thinking fast, digesting \nwhat is being said, allowing your mental faculties and your \nmemory to accept that which you understand, and to reject that \nwhich you do not understand, sorting out what you do not \nunderstand and storing them somewhere in your brain for future \ndiscussion, and, all at the same time, rationalizing what you her, \naccepting that which you find rational and rejecting that which \nyou do not find rational. \nAfter you must have listened creatively to wha t you \nhave been told, then you can respond if the need arises. It is \nquite proper that you respond because the process of response \nenhances the art of communication. But your response ought \nto be only a necessary response, a response that will improve \nyour understanding. This response should involve your \nmonitoring, some of those things you have been told but which \nyou do not understand, or politely questioning the rationality of \nsome of the speake rs argument that your response must be \nconstructive, must enhance the communicative worth. It should \nnot be an unnecessary argument or an opportunity for you to \nexpress dissatisfaction or disaffection. The ability to listen \nproperly aids communication and understanding. \n \n6. The passage says that \nA. there are many skills of communication of which \nlistening is one \nB. the art of listening is the toughest of all communication \nskills \nC. good listening depends on perfect functioning of \nthe auditory organs \nD. good listening needs formal training. \n \n7. Creative listening involves all the following EXCEPT \nA. efficient concentration \nB. makingsurethat what hespeaker is saying isaudible \nC. that the listening must be able to think fast \nD. that there must be a co-ordination of all the \nobjectivefacilities. \n8. Creative listening implies all EXCEPT \nA. a critical enterprise \nB. an uncompromising rejection ofthe speaker\u2019s \nargument \nC. some argument with the speaker \nD. a greater deal of discipline. \n9. The tone of the passage is \nA. sermonizing B. pleading C. analytical \nD. argumentative \n \n10. A most suitable title for the passage is \nA. Communication skills \nB. How to listen attentively \nC. Listening in Communication \nD. Listening argument and understanding. \nPASSAGE III \nIn the past learning English as a separate subject seemed \nrelatively easy. The textbook selected and graded items of \nlanguage which were put into context and then practised \nintensively. New items were carefully controlled so that he \nstudent could cope quite easily. Now that English is used  as a \nmedium of instruction, however, all this has changed. unknown \nitems of grammar and vocabulary appear in texts which attempt \nto explain new and often difficult information. Difficulties with \nthe language interact with difficulties as regards the subject \nmatter. The student\u2019s reading in his own subject slows down \nand his comprehension becomes less secure. He expresses \nhimself slowly and often fails to convey his ideas exactly. He is \ndisappointed to find that under pressure he makes a lot of \nunnecessary mistakes in areas where he knows the correct \nlanguage forms. His social relations are difficult as he cannot \nfind the right phrase quickly enough to keep a conversation",
