On arrival on campus, I expected to be met by \nsome stale students (as was the practice in my secondary school) \nbut every student around was new like myself.  I asked the way \nto Grant Hall but no one could tell me. I asked a number of other \nquestions about issues that bothered me, such as where and \nhow to pay the fees, the way to the dinning hall and so on, but \nno help was forthcoming. So in the midst of so many people I am \nall alone I mused to myself.
