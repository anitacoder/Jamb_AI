The \nresistance of the shunt is \nA. 2.00 B. 2.22 \nC. 18.00 D. 18.22 \n47. What type of reaction is represented by the \nfollowing scheme? 2 X +  2 Y 3 Z + 1 n + energy \n1 1 3 0 \n \n \nIn Fig. 5 above, M and N are insulated metal \nspheres in contact. A negatively charged ebonite \nrod P is brought near M. when M and N are \nseparated and the rod is taken away, which of the \nfollowing statements is CORRECT? \nA. Both M and N have acquired negative \ncharges \nB. Both M and N have acquired positive \ncharges \nC. M has acquired negative charge and N \npositive charge \nD. M has acquired positive charge and N \nnegative charge. \n42. When a transformer has more secondary windings \nthan primary winding, it \nA. Has a smaller seconder current \nB. Has a greater power output \nC. Is a step-down transformer \nD. Increases the total energy output. \n43. A current of 0.5A flows through a resistor when \nconnected to a 40-V battery. How much energy is \ndissipated in 2 minutes? \nA. 1 200J B. 1 500J \nC. 2 400J D. 96 000J. \n44. The direction of the magnetic field at a point in the \nvicinity of a bar magnet is \nA. Always towards the north pole of the \nmagnet \nB. Always away from the south pole of the \nmagnet \nC. Along the line joining the point to the \nneutral point \nD. In the direction the north pole of a \ncompass needle would point. \n45. When two parallel wires carry currents in opposite \ndirections, the force on either wire is \nA. Away from the other wire \nB. Zero, because the currents cancel each \nother \nC. Twice as much as when the currents are \nin the same direction \nD. Towards the other wire. \nA. Fusion reaction \nB. Fission reaction \nC. Chain reaction \nD. Radioactivite decay. \n48. Which of the following statements is TRUE of \nphotoelectric effect? \nA. It cannot occur in liquids \nB. The energy of the emitted electron is \nindependent of the work function of the \nsurface \nC. The energy of the emitted electron \ndepends on the wavelength of the \nincident light \nD. The greater the intensity of the incident, \nthe greater the energy of the emitted \nelectron. \n49. Isotopes are nuclei which have \nA. The same number of neutrons and \nelectrons  \nB. Equal number of electrons and protons \nC. The same atomic number but different \nnumber of neutrons \nD. The same number of total particles. \n \n50. A radioactive sample initially contains N atoms. \nAfter three half-lives the number of atoms that have \ndisintegrated is \nA.  N \n8 \nB. 3N \n8 \nC. 5N \n8 \nD. 7N \n8 \nP - \n  Fig. 5",
