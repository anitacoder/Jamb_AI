But now it happens that, with many of them, \nthe reason may be medical. The young aren\u2019t listening because \nthey can\u2019t hear. Just as nagging parents have long suspected, \notologists (hearing specialists) now report that youngsters are \ngoing deaf as a result of blasting their eardrums with \nelectronically amplified rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. \nThe hearing specialists used to worry about loud noise \nas a cause of deafness only in industrial and military situations. \nThey knew that eight hours of daily exposure, year in and year \nout, to the din of the proverbial boiler factory, would eventually \nresult in permanent hearing loss. Riveters were particularly \nsusceptible. Then they learned that the same thing happened to \naviators. After the advent of jets, the hazard applied to ground \ncrews at airports and flight-deck personnel aboard aircraft carriers \n\u2013 hence the introduction of insulated, noise -absorbing plastic \nearmuffs. \nIn discotheques and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll joints, the trouble is \nnot much in the instruments themselves, or the close quarters. \nThe blame goes to the electronic amplifiers. An old-fashioned \nmilitary band, playing a march in Ramat Park, generated as much \nsound. But the sound was not amplified and was dissipated in \nthe open air. A trombonist sitting in front of a tuba player might \nbe a bit deaf for an hour or so after a concert; then his hearing \nreturned to normal. A microphone hooked up to a public address \nsystem did not appreciably increase the hearing hazard. What \nhe did was multiple microphones and speakers, and the \ninstallation of internal microphones in such instruments as \nguitars and bouzoukis. \n \n1. The young are not listening to their elders because \nA. they never have \nB. their parents nag constantly \nC. they are permanently deaf \nD. they appear to be going deaf. \n \n2. \u2018Just as nagging parents have long suspected implies \nthat the parents suspected\u2019 that \nA. their children did not listen to them \nB. children could not hear properly after listening \nto amplified music \nC. otologists were always right \nD. children were disobedient because they did \nnot listen to their parents. \n \n3. What is the result of being subjected to the din of the \nproverbial boiler factory for a prolonged length of time? \nA. loss of hearing which will never improve. \nB. Total deafness eight hours a day. \nC. Temporary deafness. \nD. Hearing loss which can be corrected by \nmedical treatment. \n \n4. \u2018The same thing happened to aviators\u2019 This excerpt \naccording to the passage means \nA. that riveters were particularly susceptible \nB. industrial and military deafness \nC. that continued loud noise resulted in deafness \nD. that working in a boiler factory affected one\u2019s \nhearing. \n \n5. What is the difference between an old-fashioned military \nband on the one hand and discotheques and rock \u2018n\u2019 \nroll joints on the other? \nA. One is old-fashioned while the other is modern. \nB. One produces sounds for marching, the other \nfor disco. \nC. One has drums, the other has guitars. \nD. One produces amplified sounds, the other \ndoes not. \n \nPASSAGE II \nThe preparation which a study of the humanities can \nprovide, stems from three observations about education in our \nworld of accelerating social and technological change. First, \nwith the rate of change, we cannot hope to train our students \nfor specific technologies. That kind of vocational education is \nobsolescent. By the time the specific training will have been \ncompleted the world will have moved on. \nIf our education of narrow training, we will not be prepared \nto change. Second, and paradoxically, what our students desire \nfrom their education is preparation for specific careers, \u2013 business, \nengineering, medicine, computer programming and the like, but \nwe will not be able to train them for a life -long career. Their \nconfronting the depressed job market gives our students a certain \nanxiety, but the s olution they seek in vocation training is not \nsufficient. Third, we sense in our students a narrowing \nmaterialism, with the good life defined in terms of material \ncomforts. Education, then means learning to do a job which will \nmake money. I see in this definition a limiting sense of what \neducation and thus life offer, a definition which excludes joy \nand meaning. Our approach to the study of the humanities \nresponds to these three related problems. In our changing, yet \nnarrowing world, the teaching of the humanities finds one \npowerful justification \u2013 it teaches students how to think. \n \n6. \u2018Our world of accelerating social and technological change\u2019 \nmeans that \nA. our world is moving toofast socially and technologically \nB. our world is going through more rapid, social and \ntechnological change \nC. thesocial and technological changeis moreexhilarating \nthan before \nD.  the social and technological change is accelerating \nour world.",
