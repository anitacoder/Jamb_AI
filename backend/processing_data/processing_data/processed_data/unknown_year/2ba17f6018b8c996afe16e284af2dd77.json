But there is nothing \nso far from official quarters to suggest that deregulation will \ncause the Government to relinquish its control of the oil industry \nbecause the absence of direct control does not mean that it will \nsurrender all its rights to the entrepreneurs who may want to \nparticipate in the industry. Yet the opposition expressed so far \nagainst deregulation stems from the fear that the Government \nwould leave Nigerians at the mercy of a heartless cartel who \nwould command the heights of the oil industry and cause the \npump price of fuel to rise above the means of most Nigerians. \nAs a result of such fears, many Nigerians have become \nresentful of deregulation and, in fact, the Nigeria Labour \nCongress (NLC) has threatened to \u2018deregulate\u2019 the Government \nif it should go ahead with the deregulation plan. But Nigerians \nhave not fared any better with the economy totally in Government \ncontrol. Until recently, the most important sectors of the economy \nwere in the hands of the Government. Today, the deregulation of \nsome of these sectors has broken its monopoly and introduced \nhealthy competition to make things a little easier for Nigerians. \nA good example is the breaking of the stifling monopoly of \nNigeria Airways. Today, the traveler is king at the domestic \nairports as opposed to the struggle that air travels used t o be \nunder Nigeria Airways monopoly. Before, it was almost easier \nfor a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for travellers \nto board a plane. \nFollowing from this, the apostles of deregulation rightly \nheap all the blame for the problems associated  with petroleum \nproducts distribution in this country squarely on the \nGovernment, which owns all the refineries and which sells fuel \nto local consumers through its agency, the Nigerian National \nPetroleum Corporation (NNPC). In the same way, the Government \nargues that if the current NNPC monopoly were broken with the \nintroduction of entrepreneurs to the refining and sale of \npetroleum products in the country, the Nigerian people would \nbe all the better for it. It stands to reason that once the Government \ncontinues to fix maximum prices for petroleum products in this \ncountry, the deregulation of the oil sector should bring some \nrelief to the people by ensuring that wastage, corruption and \ninefficiency are reduced to the minimum. Consumers will al so \nhave the last laugh because competition will result in  the \navailability of the products at reasonable prices. This appears to \nbe the sense in deregulation. \n \n6. An appropriate title for this passage is \nA. The Advantages of a Deregulated Economy \nB. Highlighting the Dangers of Deregulation \nC. Making a Case for Deregulation \nD. The problems of the NNPC \n \n7. Which of the following statements is true according to \nthe passage? \nA. The opposition to the deregulation of the oil \nindustry is not unanimous. \nB. The Nigeria Labour Congress has been able \nto prevent the Government from deregulating \nthe economy. \nC. The introduction of entrepreneurs to the oil \nindustry will make life easy only for a few \nNigerians. \nD. A better life for all Nigerians is conditional \nupon the deregulation of the economy. \n \n8. The writer seems to suggest that \nA. Nigerians do not understand the sense in \nderegulation. \nB. a deregulated economy will cause the \nGovernment to be indifferent to the plight of \nordinary Nigerians. \nC. only a heartless cartel will benefit by the \nderegulation of the oil industry. \nD. the anxiety caused by the deregulation \nquestion is groundless. \n \n9. Which of the following conclusions can be reached \nfrom \nthe passage? \nA. Nigerians cannot buy fuel at exorbitant prices. \nB. The deregulation of the oil industry does not \nprecludethe Governmentfromexerting itsinfluence. \nC. The deregulation of the economy will solve \nall the problems of petroleum products \ndistribution. \nD. The Government is hell-bent on leaving \nNigerians at the mercy of a heartless cartel. \n \n10. Which of these correctly summarizes the arguments \nadduced by the advocates of deregulation? \nA. Deregulating the economy will make the NNPC \nmore efficient and less wasteful. \nB. Competition in the oil industry will be beneficia \nto several Nigerians. \nC. Competition should be allowed in the \nproduction \nand distribution of petroleum products. \nD. The Government should deregulate every \naspect of the Nigerian economy. \n \nPASSAGE III \nRecognizing the need for objectivity in their work, the \nearly report writers worked to develop a writing style which \nwould convey this attitude. They reasoned that the source of \nthe subjective quality in a report is the human being. And they \nreasoned that objectivity is best attained by emphasizing the",
