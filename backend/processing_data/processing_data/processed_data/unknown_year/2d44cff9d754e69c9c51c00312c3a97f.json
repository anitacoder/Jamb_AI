It is now a worldwide organization, dedicated to helping \nneedy children everywhere. The SCF of Malawi was formed in \n1953, under the patronage of His Excellency the Life President \nNgawazi Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda. \n\u2018Our job in Malawi is to give those unfortunate children \nthe rights that they are deprived of through no fault of theirs. \nThese are internationally recognized as the ten rights of children \nand include protection, care, food and accommodation, and \nrelief\u2019, a spokesman for the Fund explained. \nOne of those who benefited from the help of the Fund is \nSamuel Mpetechula, a graduate of Chancellor. His sponsorship \nstarted in 1967. The SCF of Malawi found him sponsors. They \nwere Mr. and Mrs. Sutton of Australia who paid his school fees \nand continued to help him financially throughout his University \neducation. \nMr. Mpetechula said, \u2018They even built a house for me at \nhome and looked after my family while I was a student. They \nwere really helpful to me, and the thought that there were these \nsponsors caring for me from thousands of kilometers away from \nhere was an encouragement for me to work hard at college\u2019. \nAnother important function of the work of the SCF is in \nthe field of nutrition. With the help of the Australian Government, \nthe SCF established two nutrition rehabilitation centers for \nchildren; one at Mpemba and another in Mulanje. \u2018The object of \nthe centre\u2019, explained Mr. Petre Chimbe, the Executive Secretary \nof the Fund, \u2018is to combat malnutrition in children, by giving \nthem the proper food.\u2019 \n11.

And the beast is the half \nI like the best.\u2019 The priest meant that few beasts behave as badly \nas man when man makes up his mind to behave badly. If you \nlook at the folly and cruelty of today\u2019s world, it is hard to disagree \nwith the diplomat or the priest. But human nature can be changed. \nAnybody, if that is what they most want to do, can change the \nmost difficult person they know. The art of changing people has \nbeen lost in the modern world. That is why the modern world \nhas lost its way. \nThere are two ways of looking at human nature. One is to \nmake the best of it as it is and assume that it is the raw material of \nlife which cannot be altered. That is what most people in the free \nworld do today. In these circumstances, if you expect the worst, \nyou are seldom disappointed. Faith today has become irrelevant \nto the everyday needs of so many people in  positions  of \nresponsibility because they do not expect faith to change men. \nAnother way of dealing with human nature is to exploit \nit. All materialists, whether of the right or the left, do this.  All \nover the world vanity, fear, ambition, lust and greed are used to \ncontrol the life of men; and if the control breaks down, man does \nnot hesitate to use force, or to destroy life. The end, he says, \njustifies the means and men are only of value in so far as they are \na means towards the achievement of his ambition. If they cannot \nbe bribed or forced to play their part, then they must be liquidated. \n16. The priest meant that \nA. man is both beast and human \nB. man could be sores than a beast if he wants to",
