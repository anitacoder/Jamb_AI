Each question carries 3 marks. \n \nPASSAGE III \nWe knew early in our life that the atmosphere in our \nhome was different from that in many other homes, where \nhusbands and wives quarrel and where there was drunkenness, \nlaziness or indifference \u2013 things we never saw in our family. We \nchafed and grumbled at the strictness of my father\u2019s regime. We \nwent to hide whenever we broke the rules too visibly. We knew, \nnevertheless, that our parents wanted good things for us. Some \nof these, such as the insistence on our going to school and \nnever missing a day, we accepted readily enough, although, like \nmost other children, we occasionally yielded to the temptation \nto play truant. However, in other cases such as their effort to \nkeep us out of contact with the difficult life \u2013 the drinking and \nfighting and beer -brewing and gambling \u2013 their failure was \ninevitable. They could not keep us insulated. By the time we \nmoved about, we were already seeing things with their eyes and \njudging things by the standards we had absorbed from them. \nIt was borne in on me and my brother at a very early \nage that our father was an uncommon man . For one thing, in \nmost African families, work around the home was women\u2019s work. \nSo we were vastly impressed by the fact that whenever my mother \nwas away, my father could and did do all her jobs \u2013 cooking, \ncleaning and looking after us. We lived in this way in a community \nin which housework was regarded as being beneath male dignity. \nEven in families which, like ours, produced boy after boy \u2013 our \nsister came fifth \u2013 it simply meant that the mother carried a greater \nand greater burden of work. In our family, nevertheless, the boys \ndid girl\u2019s work and my father did it with us. \nOne of the prime chores of life in the family was fetching \nwater from the pump down the street, some two hundred metres \nfrom our door. Since the pump was not unlocked until six in the \nmorning and there was always crowding, a system had developed \nwhereby you got out before dawn, placed your twenty-litre tin \nin line, and then went home, returning later to take your place. \nOften, of course, tins would be moved back in line and others \nmoved ahead. This could be corrected if none of those in front \nwere too big a challenge. \nWhen taps were substituted for the pumps, the first one \ninstalled was nearly a kilometre away from our house and we \nhad to make the treck with the water tins balanced on our heads \n-- and indignity because this was the way girls, not proud males, \ncarried their burdens. All the children in the neibghbourhood \nknew we did women\u2019s work and I can  still hear their  derisive \nlaughter. We did our jobs doggedly, that notwithstanding, \nbecause our father and mother expected it of us. Out of choice \nour father did everything we did, including fetching water on \nthe occasion, and commanded us by sheer force of his example. \n \n16. By describing his father as an uncommon man, the \nwriter \nmeans that he is \nA. amenable B. remarkable C. strict D. kind \n \n17. Which of the following describes the father\u2019s role in \nthe family? \nA. Being too hard on the children. \nB. Usurping his wife\u2019s role in the family. \nC. Serving the children. \nD. Leading by example. \n \n18. The word atmosphere, as used in the first paragraph of \nthe passage, means \nA. pattern B. disposition C. preference D. unity \n \n19. Which of the following statements captures the family\u2019s \napproach to housework? \nA.  No job was reserved for anyone on the basis \nof gender. \nB. Their mother did the cooking and cleaning \nwillingly. \nC. The boys were not allowed to do girls work. \nD. The water needed was provided by everyone. \n \n20. A suitable title for the passage is \nA. A Village Life B. The Unusual Parent \nC. The Problem of Water D. An Experience in Early life. \n \nPASSAGE IV \nA Wolf, seeing a Lamb drinking from a river, wanted to find a \npretext for devouring him. He stood higher up the stream and \naccused the lamb of muddying the water so that he could not \ndrink. The lamb said that he drank only with tip of his tongue, \nand that in any case he was standing lower down the river, and \ncould not possibly disturb the water higher up. When this excuse \nfailed him, the wolf said: \u2018Well, last year you insulted my father.\u2019 \n\u2018I wasn\u2019t even born then,\u2019 replied the lamb. \n\u2018You are good at finding answers, \u2018said the wolf, \u2018but \nwhat do you mean by taking up so much of the path where I am \nwalking? The lamb, frightened at the wolf\u2019s angry tone and \nterrible aspect, told him, with all due submission, that he could \nnot conceive how his walking on such a wide path could \noccasion him inconvenience. \u2018What!\u2019 exclaimed the wolf, \nseemingly in great anger and indignation. \u2018You are as impudent \nas your father who seized me by the throat last year, and caused \nme to be kept in a cage for three months.\u2019 \n\u2018If you will believe me,\u2019 said the lamb, \u2018my parents are \npoor simple creatures who live entirely by green stuff; we are \nnone of us hunters of your species.\u2019 \u2018Ah! I see it\u2019s no use talking \nto you, \u2018said the wolf, drawing up close to him. \u2018It runs in the \nblood of your family to hate us wolves, and therefore, as we \nhave come so conveniently together, I\u2019ll just pay off a few of \nyour forefathers\u2019 scores before we part. \u2018So saying, he leapt at \nthe lamb from behind and garroted him. \n \n21. The charges levelled against the lamb are \nA. pollution, insolence, obstruction and \naggression.  \nB. exuberance, pollution, wickednessand \nstubbornness",
