  "content": "Use of English 2000  \n \nPASSAGE I \nTime was when boys used to point toy guns and say \n\u2018Bang!\u2019 Now, they aim real guns and shoot one another. Nearly \n4,200 teenagers were killed by firearms in 1990. Only motor vehicle \naccidents kill more teenagers than firearms and the firearms \nfigures are rising . The chance that a black male between the \nages of 15 and 19 will be killed by a gun has almost tripled since \n1985 and almost doubled for white males, according to the \nNational Centre for Health Statistics. \nWho could disagree with Health and Human Services \nSecretary, Donna Shalala, when she pronounced these statistics \n\u2018frightening and intolerable?\u2019 In the shameful light of this \u2018waste \nof young lives\u2019 in Ms. Shalala\u2019s words, an often-asked question \nseems urgently due to be raised again: Would less violence on \ntelevision \u2013 the surrounding environment for most children and \nyoung adults \u2013 make violence in actual life less normal, less \naccepted, less horrifying? \nIt may be difficult to prove an exact correlation between \nthe viewer of fantasized violence and the criminal who acts out \nviolence after turning off the set. But if the premise of education \nis granted \u2013 that good models can influence the young \u2013 then it \nfollows that bad models can have an equivalent harmful effect. \nThis is the reasonable hypothesis held by 80 percent of the \nrespondents to a recent Times Mirror poll who think that violent \nentertainment is \u2018harmful\u2019 to society. \nWitness enough mimed shootouts, see enough \n\u2018corpses\u2019 fall across the screen, and the taking of a human life \nseems no big deal. Even if a simple causal relationship cannot be \nestablished between watching violence and acting it out, is not \nthis numbed sensitivity reason enough for cutting back on the \noverkill in films and TV? \nFrom: The  Christian  Science  Monitor, April 16 \n\u2013  22, 1993, p. 20, CSPS, Boston, MA, USA. \n \n1. The writer uses \u2018numbed sensitivity\u2019 to refer to \nA. deadening of the capacity to feel \nB. objectionable behaviour \nC. heartlessness on the part of actors. \nD. unreasonable violence. \n \n2. What will actually be proved \u2018if the premise of education \nis granted\u2019? \nA. Entertainment on television is harmful to society. \nB. Violence on television encourages violence in real life. \nC. Good models can influence the young. \nD. The viewer of fantasized violence is the criminal \nwho acts out violence. \n \n3. From the passage, it can be inferred that since 1985 \nA.  more black males between the ages of 15 and 19 \nhavebeen killing one another with guns. \nB. more black males between the ages of 15 and 19 \nhave been getting killed by guns. \nC. more white than black males have been getting \nkilled \nby guns. \nD. more black than white males have been killing one \nanother with guns. \n4. The writer says \u2018the firearms figures are rising\u2019 because \nA. more teenagers are now getting killed by firearms \nthan by motor vehicle accidents \nB. firearms now have figures that are terribly high \nC. more teenagers now carry fire arms than used to be \nthe case \nD. more teenagers are now getting killed by firearms \nthan used to be the case. \n \n5. In Secretary Donna Shalala\u2019s view, the situation depicted \nby the statistics is \nA. tense and reassuring B. topical and intimidating \nC. alarming and unbearable D. disturbing and conducive. \n \nPASSAGE II \nYou would think that the common cold should be easy \nenough to study, but it is not so easy as it looks. Colds often \nseem to spread from one person to another, so it is often assumed \nthat the cold must be infectious, but there are some puzzling \nobservations which do not fit in with this theory. An investigator \nin Holland examined some eight thousand volunteers from \ndifferent areas and came to the conclusion that in each group \nthe colds all appeared at the same time \u2013 transfer of infection \nfrom case to case could not account for that. Yet at the Common \nCold Research Unit in Salisbury the infection theory has been \ntested out; two series of about two hundred people each were \ninoculated, one with salt water and the other with secretions \nfrom known cold victims. Only one of the salt-water group got a \ncold, compared with seventy-three in the other group. \nIn the British Medical Journal the other day, there was \na report of a meeting, \u2018The Common Cold -- Fact and Fancy\u2019, at \nwhich one of the speakers reported a study of colds made in \nCirencester over the last five years. Three hundred and fifty \nvolunteers had kept diary records of their colds and on an average \neach had seven every year, with an annual morbidity of seventy \ndays. So nearly one -fifth of our lives is spent in more or less \nmisery, coughing and sneezing. Some widely held beliefs about \nthe common cold have turned out not to be true. It seems that \nold people are just as liable to colds as the young. Sailors in \nisolated weather ships have just as many colds while on board \nand not in contact with the outside world as when on shore. It is \na truism that common illnesses pose more problems than the \nrare. The rare disease is by comparison much easier to handle. \nThere are not so many cases and all of them have been \nintensively studied. Someone has read up all the literature about \nthe disease and published a digest of it. There will be more facts \nand fewer fancies. \nMiles Howard: \u2018The Spectator\u2019 \n \n6. Which of the following statements can be implied from \nthe passage? \nA. People catch more colds in winter. \nB. The origin of colds is inconclusive. \nC. People catch more colds in warm weather. \nD. People catch cols equally in warm and cold weather. \n \n7. A rare disease can be more easily dealt with than the \ncommon cold because \nA. medical experts are fed up with the rampant cases of \ncommon colds \nB. people easily develop resistance to the common colds \nC. a dequate research exists to uncover facts bout such",
