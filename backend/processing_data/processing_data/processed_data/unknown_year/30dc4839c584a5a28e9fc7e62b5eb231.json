Artificial quartz is produced \nA. in Brazil \nB. from tiny transistors \nC. in an astonishing number of devices \nD. with the help of thermionic valves \nE. from natural crystals within steel cylinders. \n \nIII \n \nEvery artist\u2019s work, unless he be a hermit, creating solely \nfor his own satisfaction and with no need of sales, is to some \nextent \u2018socially conditioned\u2019; he depends upon the approval of \nhis patrons. Social conditioning is of course part of the field of \nstudy of the social anthropologist, yet I am not aware that the \nsocial conditioning of artists has ever been seriously studied. \nThat such study is needed for the proper appraisal of traditional \nAfrican art is evident enough when we note the ingenuous \nassumption, current in many writings on the subject, that the \ncarver\u2019s hand is so closely controlled by the custom of centuries \nthat the credit for any creative imagination which is apparent in \nhis work is due not to him but to the long succession of his \npredecessors.  \nOf course, there is an element of trust in this view of the \ntribal artist as copyist, but it is hardly more valid for the African \nthan for the European artist. In both cases the work of art is the \noutcome of a dialectic between the informing tradition and the \nindividual genius of the artist, and in both the relative strength \nof these two forces may vary almost infinitely. To assess the \npersonal ingredient in an African carving is no easy matter, \nespecially if one is confronted with a rare or unique piece in an \nunfamiliar style; but the considerations involved are much the \nsame as those employed in European art criticism. \n \n11. Most artists are strongly influenced by the \nA. desire for self-expression. B. need to sell their works \nC. tastes and wishes of the society \nD. creative imagination E. opinions of critics. \n \n12. A social anthropologist is someone who \nA. studies only social conditioning \nB. is interested in art and artists \nC. studies social conditions and other things \nD. is interested in thecommunity E. studies theorigins ofman. \n \n13. It would be useful to study the social conditioning of \nartist because \nA. we know that African art is entirely influenced by \ntradition. \nB. traditional art arises from the customs of the people \nC. an artist\u2019s predecessors solely determine the nature \nof his work \nD. we do not know the extent to which an artist is \ninfluenced by his society \nE. we do not know very much about how an artist\u2019s \ncreative imagination works. \n \n14. \u2018The work of art is the outcome of a dialectic between \nthe informing tradition and the individual genius of the \nartist\u2019 means that \nA. the artist is influenced both by the society and by \nhis own creative imagination \nB. there is an irreconcilable conflict between an artist\u2019s \ncreativity and the demands that society makes on him. \nC. the artist subordinates his individual talent to the \ndemands of the society \nD. few works of art are entirely original \nE. the individual artist needs to be informed about the \ntraditions of the society. \n \n15. Which of the following represents the writer\u2019s view about \nAfrican art in relation to European Art? \nA. The African artist is influenced by his society, but the \nEuropean artist is not \nB. In both African and European art there is a blend of \ntradition and individual creativity \nC. African art is tribal, but European art is not \nD. Although traditional influences can be seen in \nEuropean art, they are much less strong than they are \nin African art \nE. African artists are more imitative than European artists. \n \nIV \n \nOne day, Alan, a friend of mine, who likes country life, \nwas fishing in a river, when he caught a trout. He tried to pull the \nfish in but it slipped off the hook, flew over his head and landed \nin a field behind him. \nAlan put down his rod, went through the gate and started \nsearching for his trout. Some people, obviously from the city, \nwere having a picnic in the field. One of the men shouted \u2018What \non earth are you doing?\u2019 Thinking that it was a stupid question \nbecause they could see how he was dressed, Alan replied \n\u2018Fishing\u2019. \n\u2018Don\u2019t be silly, the fish are down in the river\u2019, answered \nthe man. \u2018Fish don\u2019t live in fields!\u2019 He turned to his friends, \nlaughing, thinking that he had made a good joke. \n\u2018Oh, but they do\u2019, said Alan. \u2018They jump out of the river \nto look for flies and I catch them with my hands. \u2018At that moment \nhe found his trout in the grass and picked it up and showed it to \nthe picnickers. He put it in his basket and bent down, as if he \nwas hunting for another one. The picnickers, no longer laughing, \nspent the rest of the day searching the field. \n \n16. Why did the fish land in the field? \nA   it had wings B. it was a flying fish \nC.  it was looking for food D. Alan pulled too hard. \nE. it fell off the hook. \n \n17. The picnickers were \nA. farmers B. from the nearby village C. tourists \nD.  people from the city E. anglers like him. \n \n18. Where was Alan looking for his fish? He was looking for \nthe fish \nA. in the grass, B. down in the river \nC. in front of the gate D. in his basket \nE. among the picnickers. \n \n19. Alan made the picnickers believe that fish jump out of \nthe river to look for flies by \nA. telling a story. \nB. finding his trout and showing it to them \nC. taking them down to the river \nD. watching how trout catch flies",
