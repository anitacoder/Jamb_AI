  "content": "population growth rate that was at best  guess  work.  \nNotwithstanding that the margin of error could be as large as \nplus or minus 20 million, economists have still felt confident to \nspeak of Nigeria\u2019s per capita income, birth and mortality rates, \nliteracy rates and so on, as if they were quoting precise figures. \nSo much in Nigeria is determined on the basis of population \nthat the lack of accurate figures has a significantly adverse \neffect on policies. One obviously affected area is \ndevelopment planning, which, for the lack of reliable data, \nfrequently looks like an exercise in futility. An example of what \nhappens is the country\u2019s Universal Primary Education (UPE) \nscheme launched in 1976. Policy makers had expected, on the \nbasis of the 1975/76 primary school enrolment of just under 5 \nmillion, that they would not have to cope with much more than 6 \nmillion school children in the first year. But the enrolment in \n1976/77 turned out to be 8.4 million rising to 10.1 million the \nfollowing year. The unanticipated cost of catering for the larger \nnumber was the main cause of the collapse of that worthy scheme \nafter only four years. \nPopulation also plays an important role in revenue \nallocation, specifically in the sharing of the states portion of the \nFederation Account, some percentage of which is based on \npopulation or population related factors. Because of the \ncontentious nature of the subject, the compromise has been to \nuse estimates based on the 1963 census figures, even when \nsuch a move produc es ridiculous situations. It is for all these \nreason that the Babangida Administration\u2019s effort to ascertain \nthe nations\u2019 population is such a worthwhile venture. \n \n \n6. It would be more realistic of economists to \nA. accept the unreliability of Nigeria\u2019s census figures \nB. ascertain how many Nigerians there are \nC. discard the disputed 1963 census figures \nD. accept marginal errors in the census figures. \n \n7. Precise national population figures are required in order \nto know the \nA. know the number of people to cater for in the \nUniversal Primary Education Programme \nB. be able to undertake proper implementation \nof governmental policies \nC. avert unanticipated expenditures \nD. be able to speak of population statistics with \nconfidence. \n \n8. \u2018The contentious nature of the subject refers to \nA. the population \nB. the disputed 1963 census figures \nC. development planning \nD. revenue allocation. \n9.  The reference to \u2018Universal Primary Education\u2019 in this \npassage is significant because it shows \nA. why the census figures were disputed \nB. the failure and collapse of the programme \nC. the misleading effect of unreliable information \nD. how a worthy scheme could be made \nworthless by poor planning strategies. \n10. As far as the solution to the population problem of \nNigeria is concerned, the writer of this passage is \nA. optimistic B. pessimistic C. indifferent D. disturbed. \nPASSAGE III \nLet\u2019s begin with a picture. He must not have been more \nthan thirty years old. The oval face devoid of those wrinkles of \nage, the well turfed and black hair and his complete though \nbrown set of teeth supported this assessment. All he had for \nclothing was a piece of cloth with some words written on it. It \nmust have been one of those cloth -posters used by now \nabandoned by \u2018show-biz promoters. Across his neck was yet \nanother cloth which bore our national colours of green and white. \nHis feet were naked just they came from their creator. In one \nhand he had an empty tin. He talked ceaselessly and in a \ndisordered fashion. The other free hand emphasized his spoken \nwords and gestures. As he talked, he gazed at you as if you were \nresponsible for his pathetic condition. He looked redeemable, \nthough. There are many of his type in various Urban centers. \nBeggars! They are in every conceivable place. At the \nbank, the supermarket, the church, the mosque, the post office \nthere you will meet them. Before you know it, the more healthy \nones besiege you for alms almost to the point assault. Surely, \nthere is no rationale in giving alms to someone who is physically \nstronger than you are and who, from all indications, can and \nshould work and fend for himself. Some others are feeble \nunfortunately handicapped. Women and young girls constitute \na sizeable number of these healthy beggars. Some are nursing \nmothers and one wonders that their husbands are. Conception \nby Mr. Nobody, perhaps. The young girls in this category are \nthe mother beggars of tomorrow. But tell me, can\u2019t the society be \nspared this human waste? \n \n11. The writer is describing a \nA. picture B. man C. picture of a man D. man and a picture. \n \n12. \u2026 this assessment\u2019 refers to the man\u2019s \nA. face B. hair C. age D. naked feet. \n \n13. \u2018Beggars\u2019 in the context of the first line of the third \nparagraph is a \nA. phrase B. sentence C. noun D. modifier. \n \n14. The human waste referred to by the writer is brought \nabout by \nA. over-feeding \nB. the irresponsible men who female beggars in \nthe family way \nC. the mother-beggars of tomorrow \nD. the society. \n \n15. An appropriate title for the passage is \nA. A picture, the young man and female beggars \nB. Mad men and mendicants \nC. The problem of mad people in the society \nD. Young men and female beggars. \n \nLEXISAND STRUCTURE \n \nUse the passage below to answer questions 16 to 25. The \npassage has gaps numbered 16 to 25.
