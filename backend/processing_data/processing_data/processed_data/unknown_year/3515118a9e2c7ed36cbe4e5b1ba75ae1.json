And yet \nhe was still not sure. Was this the house he had visited so often \nin the past? The house he used to visit was a bungalow. This \nhouse, too, was a bungalow. The old house was situated between \ntwo-storeyed building: this one too was so situated. But in spite \nof this feeling of certainty, chike had a vague suspicion that the \nhouse he had passed so often that day might be the wrong \nhouse after all. Could an absence of two years have blurred his \nmemory so badly? \nAfter a few moments\u2019 hesitation, Chike began to move \ntowards the house and then stopped, as if held back by an \ninvisible hand. His attention had been attracted by a girl of \nabout twenty-four, who was tripping along the pavement to his \nright. He turned and advanced towards her, and was about to \ncall her by what he felt was her name when he discovered that he \nhad made a mistake in respect of her identity. \nJust as Chike turned from the girl to continue his quest, \nhe heard voices shouting, \u2018thief! thief!\u2019 and saw a crowd \nmaterialize in seconds. At the head of this justice-impelled rabble, \nwas a ludicrously fat woman who, in spite of her size, bounced \nalong with the agility of a prize athlete. This barrel bellowed \nloudest and clapped her hands vigorously to punctuate her \noutburst. And as she did so the surplus flesh on her pudgy arms \nquivered. \u2018They are all the same\u2019, this woman screamed, \naddressing nobody in particular. \u2018they dress gorgeously, but \nunderneath they are rogues.\u2019 \nAgain, she clapped her hands and again, there was a \nquivering of loose flesh. Chike was so busily occupied with \nwatching the antics of this woman that he did not notice at first \nthat the object of her venom was the girl he had seen earlier. It \nwas this girl that was now surrounded by the crowd, with many \npeople groaning. Sighing and hissing in unison. \nChike relaxed, and prepared to watch the drama unfolding \nbefore him. \n1. The expression, \u2018blurred his memory\u2019 means \n \nA. confused him B. erased his memory \nC. damaged his brain D. distorted his thoughts. \n \n2. Chike left the girl alone because he \nA. discovered that she was a thief \nB. was afraid of the fat woman \nC. did not known her \nD. did not like her. \n \n3. Many people in the crowd groaned, sighed and hissed \nbecause they were \nA. angry with the girl \nB. sorry for the girl \nC. sorry for the fat woman \nD. angry that the woman had lied against the \ngirl. \n \n4.

The impression one has of the fat woman described in \nthe passage is that she is \nA. the thief B. a good person C. overzealous \nD. domineering. \n \nPASSAGE II \nTheatre in the recent past used to be a very popular art \nin traditional African society. It used to be a point of intersection \nwhere members of the community not only come to entertain \nthemselves, but \u2018join heads together\u2019. In the traditional context \nAfrican drama therefore, Theatre was a popular and respectable \ninstitution, which preserved the people\u2019s culture and tradition. \nTheatre was popular with the people because it emphasized \ncommunity participation, peace and progress. The presentations \nfocused on the people\u2019s lives, their aspirations, fears and hopes.",
