  "content": "Use of English 1983  \n \nCOMPREHENSION \n \nRead each passage carefully andanswer thequestionsthat follow it. \n \nThe approach to the University is being restructured \nto ease the flow of traffic, give better security and provide an \nappropriate introduction to a seat of higher learning. The Works \nand Services Complex is also under construction , and we intend \nto move into the completed {major}part of it within the next few \nweeks. \nAll these projects are being executed with an eye to \naesthetics, for we recognize the important influence of a beautiful \nand healthy environment on its inhabitants and feel that a cluster \nof buildings on a small space such as we have , should be so \nwell designed as to have a beneficial psychological and \nsociological effect on all members of the community. \nI have gone to these lengths to itemize these examples of \ncurrent development for two main reason. Firstly , to advise you \nthat the road diversions and other physical inconveniences \ncurrently being experienced will be on the increase because of \nintense development activity. We therefore appeal to you to \nbear with us in full knowledge and consolation that such \ninconveniences are temporary and will soon yield final tangible \nresults. Secondly, to demonstrate our capacity for executing \napproved proje cts with dispatch, and to assure Government \nthat we are up to the task. Indeed, I can assure Government that \nits ability to disburse funds to us will be more than matched by \nour capacity to collect and expend them on executing various \nworthy projects in record time. \n \n1. From the passage we can gather that \nA. there is not muchconsideration for the health of \nthe inhabitants. \nB. there is deliberate effort to inconvenience the \npeople \nC. buildings are put up anyhow \nD. projects are carried out without approval \nE. the inconveniences suffered by the inhabitants \nwill be for a while. \n \n2. Unless it can be shown that the money voted for projects \ncan be spent on them in good time. \nA. the development activity will not be intense. \nB. it will not be easy to convince the Government of \nour executive ability \nC. it will not be difficult to ask Government for funds \nD. our final results will be unreliable. \nE. the road diversions and other inconveniences \nwill continue. \n \n3. An eye to aesthetics in this passage means \nA. regard for space. B. beneficial psychological effects \nC.   regard for health D. consideration for beauty \nE. a cluster of buildings. \n \n4. In this passage the author tries to explain why \nA. it is necessary to establish the Works and Services \nComplex in the University. \nB. beauty should not be taken into consideration when \nbuilding on such a small space as we have \nC. the gateway to the university is being rebuilt \nD. major part of the project should be completed in the \nnext few weeks. \nE. visitors should be debarred from using the gates in \nthe meantime. \n \n5. Which of these is NOT among the reasons given by the \nauthor for enumerating the examples of the current \ndevelopment? \nA. to show that we are capable of executing approved \nprojects. \nB. to convince the Government that we can be trusted \nwith task. \nC. the inconvenience currently being experienced will \ngo on indefinitely. \nD. we are fully aware of the inconveniences being caused \nbut we do not want you to complain. \nE. we have the capacity to complete worthy projects \nwithin the scheduled time. \n \nII \nIs work for prisoners a privilege to save them from the \ndemoralizing effects and misery of endless unoccupied hours? \nIs it something added to a prison sentence to make it harder and \nmore unpleasant, or something, which should have a positive \nvalue as part of a system of rehabilitation? \nThose magistrates who clung to sentences of hard labour \ndoubtless looked upon strenuous work as an additional \npunishment. This point of view is widely accepted as right and \nproper, but it ignores the fact that unwillingness to work is often \none of the immediate causes of criminality. To send prisoners \nback to the outside world, more than ever convinced that labour \nis an evil to be avoided, is to confirm them in their old way of \nlife. \nIt has been said that the purpose of prison work in a \nprogramme of rehabilitation is twofold: training for work and \ntraining by work. The prisoner, that is to say, needs to be trained \nin habits of industry; but over and above this, he will gain \nimmeasurably if it is possible to rouse in him the consciousness \nof self-mastery and of purpose that the completion of any \nworthwhile piece of work can give to the doer. He may find a \npride of achievement in something more satisfying, and more \nsocially desirable, than crime. But these things can only come \nwhen the work itself has a purpose and demands an effort. \n \n6. According to the author, some magistrates sentence \nprisoners to hard labour because. \nA. some prisoners are unwilling to work. \nB. work is a privilege \nC. prisoners need to learn a trade \nD. it is an additional punishment \nE. it is a means of rehabilitation. \n \n7. Which of these is NOT the purpose of work in a programme \nof rehabilitation? \nA. training the prisoners to have satisfaction in work. \nB. developing in them a pride in a sense of achievement. \nC. developing in them more satisfaction in work than in crime.",
