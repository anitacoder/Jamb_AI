It is in line with \nthe foregoing that the first examination in the world could be traced to the first five \nquestions in \nthe Bible.\n \nThe \nfirst was between \nSatan and the woman, and the last four were between God on \nthe one \nhand and the c\nouple Adam and Eve\n \non the other. However, \nthe first known examination \nin the world of human beings could be traced to \n1796 when Maskely\nne, not only observed but \nals\no recorded with the aid of tele\nscope, the movement of stars in England (Agbama, 2019). \nStudy\ning differences in equations and observations among human beings, Bessel, a German \nAstro\nno\nmer\n,\n \nin the year\ns\n \n1820\n-\n1833, improved on the works began by Maskelyne. However, it \nwas not until 1884 that tests and \nmeasurements\n \nof individuals started with the disc\novery of \nSir \nFrancis Galton in his laboratories (Agbama, 2019). The point must, however, be made that these \nearly examinations were informal, oral and written as the case might be.\n \n \nThe Chinese were said to have been the first people to have applied informal \nexaminations in written form in appointments into \ntheir civil service as\n \nearly as 2200 B.C\n. \nBefore 1815, the Americans were \nbelieved to have emp\nloyed the use of series of \nachievem\nent tests in their educational and civil service systems (Agbam\na, 2019). A test \ncalled the Beri\net Simon intelli\ngence test\n \nwas targ\neted at measuring the intelligen\nce of \nchildren while group te\nst was first introduced in the years \n1914\n-\n1918 to test the \nintell\nigence of soldiers (Agbama, 2019). Objective tests were developed in 1864 by George \nFisher \nand in 1877, J.M. \nRice \nintroduced what has been known as the standard objective \nscale (Agbama, 2019).\n \n \nIt is quite logical\n \nto\n \nargue that the first formal examination \nknown in Nigeria, without \nfear \no\nf\n \nself\n-\ncontradictions;\n \ncame \nparri\n \npassu\n,\n \nwith the advent of w\nestern education.\n \nThis \nperspective is more tenable if one considers the fact that transition from one level to \nanother would have required a decision as to whether\n \nthe pupils had satisfied all the \nrequirements for promotion or not. Such a decision would naturally come after a form of \ntest, measurement, evaluation and or examination in the spirit of fair play. However, the \nfirst known examination body in Nig\neria is t\nhe West African Examination\n \nCouncil \n(WAEC) which had first been established in the Gambia in 1951 and in 1952 its office was \nopened in Nigeria. \n(\nAgbama\n,\n \n2019) opined that, \ninter\n-\nalia\n, WAEC conducts examinations \nlike the West African School Certificate \nExam\nination (WASCE), General Certificate \nExamination \n(GCE), \nCity \nand Guilds and the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) Examination. \n \n \nOther examination bodies in Nigeria include the National Examination Council (NECO), \nNational Business and \nTechnical \nExamination\n \nBoard\n \n(NABTEB), the \nInternational \nCentre \nfor \nEducational\n \nEvaluation (ICEE) and \nJAMB\n.
