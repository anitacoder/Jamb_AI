  "content": "is, supply. Similarly, he is interested in how much beer is \nconsumed and how the supply of beer will adjust to the demand \nfor it. He examines the habits and the pressures which can lead \nto the readjustment of wants and the reallocation of resources \nto cover the wants. \nSome moral principles associated with religion tend to \nlead on to economic problems. Followers of certain religions are \nexpected not to consume pork, take alcohol or smoke tobacco. \nDevotees of some religious groups, on the other hand, can eat \npork while others are expected to abstain from alcohol and \nsmoking. Strict observance of these moral rules could cripple \nthe breweries, the cigarette factories and some businesses. \nHowever, there seems to be a growing number of alcohol \nconsumers and cigarette smokers \u2013 a development which should \nbe of interest to the economist. \n \n11. The positions maintained by the moralist and the \neconomist can be described as being \nA. at variance  B.  very agreeable  C.  quite indifferent \nD.    very passionate \nThis kind of delivery is usually reserved for very \u202618\u2026 (A. \nformal B. genuine C. impromptu D. guaranteed) occasions \nwhen exact wording is \u202619\u2026 (A. conclusive B. critical C. \nreportive D. speculative), such as the State of the Union Address \nor speeches before the United Nations General \u202620\u2026 (A. \nNegotiation B. Organization C. Assembly D. Audience). The \nprimary advantage is that the speech may be highly \u202621\u2026 (A. \npolished B. advanced C. analogous D. discreet ) in terms of \nword choice, turns of phrase, and development of ideas. The \nmain disadvantage is that this type of delivery is difficult to do \nwell. Reading aloud with meaningful \u202622\u2026 (A. anticipatory B. \nprofuse C. bifocal D. vocal ) inflection requires the speaker to \nbe very familiar with the text. If not, the words will come out in a \nchoppy, expressionless way. Such poor delivery could destroy \nany \u202623\u2026 (A. interactive B. restrictive C. positive D. decisive) \neffects created by the carefully chosen \u202624\u2026 (A. language B. \nslang C. dialect D. rhetoric) Lack of familiarity with the \u202625\u2026 \n(A. exchange B. text C. note D. context) could also prevent the \nspeaker from maintaining eye contact with people being \naddressed.  \n \n12. Which of the following statements is true according to \nthe passage? \nA. People who drink or smoke surely die of \ncancer. \nB. Everyone ignores the moralist view on \ndrinking and smoking. \nC. Smoking and drinking may have positive \neffects on the economy. \nD. Total abstinence from drinking and smoking \nis a religious obligation. \n \n13. It can be concluded from the passage that morality, \nreligion and economy are \nA. clearly interconnected B. certainly different \nC. somewhat interconnected D. certainly unrelated. \n \n14. The view expressed by the writer in the last paragraph \nis that \nA. the number of alcoholics and smokers is \ncertainly increasing \nB. more people now abstain from drinking and \nsmoking \nC. more people appear to take to drinking and \nsmoking \nD. sales of alcohol and tobacco products have \nimproved tremendously. \n15. According to the passage, the moralist idea is that \nA. it is typically African not to smoke cigarettes \nB. people should accept a point of view only \nwhen they are convinced \nC. smoking is not good but a little alcohol may \nbe permitted \nD. the smoking of cigarettes is bad and \nunacceptable. \n \nPASSAGE IV \n \nThe passage below has gaps numbered 16 to 25. Immediately \nfollowing each gap, four options are provided. Choose the most \nappropriate option for each gap. Each question carries 2 marks. \n \nA prepared speech is not easy to deliver, especially if it \nis not written by the presenter. A \u202616\u2026 (A. document B. free \nC. manuscript D. quantum) delivery is one in which the speech \nhas been written out word for word and is read to ...17... (A. a \ngathering B. a conference C. a congregation D. an audience). \nAdapted from Phillips, G. M. et al (1985), Speaking in \nPublic and Private, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill \n \n \nLEXIS, STRUCTUREAND ORALFORMS \n \nIn each of questions 26 to 30, select the option that best explains \nthe information conveyed in the sentence.
