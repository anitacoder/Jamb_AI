  "content": "enemies, they will be too many for us and will \ndrag us down to ruin. \nBut some people may say that they cannot \nhelp having bad thought even though they \nsting like vipers. That may be so, but the \nquestion is, do they hate them or not? We \ncannot keep thieves from looking in at our \nwindow, but if we open our doors to them and \nreceive them joyfully, we are as bad as they. \nWe cannot help the birds flying over our head; \nbut we may keep them from building their nets \nin our hair. Vain thought will knock at the door \nbut we must not open to them. Though bad \nand evil thought rise in our hearts, they must \nnot be allowed to reign. He who turns a morsel \nover and over in his mouth dose so because he \nlikes the flavour, and he who meditate upon \nevil, love it, and is ripe to commit it. Think of \nthe devil, and he will appear, turn your thought \ntoward evil and your hands will soon follow. \nSnails leaves their slime behind them, and so \ndo vain thought. An arrow may fly through the \nair, and leaves no trace, but an evil thought \nalways leaves a trail like a serpent. \n \nWhere there is much traffic of bad thinking, \nthere will be much mire and dirt. Every wave of \nwicked thought adds something to the \ncorruption which rots upon the shore of life. It \nis dreadful to think that a vile imagination, \nonce indulge, gets the key of our minds, and \ncan get in again very easily, whether or not we \nlet it in, and what may follow, no one knows. \nNurse evil on the laps of thought, and it will \ngrow into a giant \nTherefore; there is wisdom in watching every \nday, the thought and imagination of our heart. \nGood thoughts are blessed guest and should be \nwelcome, and much sought after, but bad \nthought must fly out as swiftly as they moved \nin. \n \n6. Which of the following represents the \nwriter\u2019s view in the passage? \n(a) evil thought may come but there is virtue in \nkeeping them out \n(b) evil thought will continue to sting us likes \nvipers as long as there are enemies who cause \noffence \n(c) like the pendulum, evil thought will always \ncome to our mind no matter what we do \n(d) like most birds, evil thoughts fly swiftly in \nour minds without perching \n \n7. Which of the following statement represent \nthe view expressed by the writer in the first \nparagraph? \n(a) evil thought will eventually ruin the evil \nman \n(b) if we do not stop the pendulum of thought \nfrom swinging, our thoughts will soon become \nour enemies \n(c) To many evil thoughts leave fatal \nconsequences \n(d) it is possible to decide what control our \nthoughts \n \n8. From the argument in the second paragraph, \nit can be concluded that evil thought control \nthe lives of people who \n(a) Are helpless because they fly out of their \nminds \n(b) cherries idle and slothful ways \n(c) are thieves with evil instincts \n(d) treasures and ruminate on them \n \n9. the expression \u2018Think of the devil and he will \nappear .... , as used in the passage suggests \nthat \n(a) likes the devil evil thoughts must not reign \nin our hearts \n(b) evil thoughts are fantasies which exist only \nin people\u2019s mind \n(c) uncontrolled evil thoughts may lead to evil \ndeeds \n(d) the devil gives evil thoughts only to those \nwho invite him in",
