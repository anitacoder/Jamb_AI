A group of closely related organisms \ncapable of interbreeding to produce fertile \noffspring are known as members of a \nA. kingdom \nB. class \nC. family \nD. species \n \n2. A beaker of pond water containing few \nspecimens of Euglena was placed in a dark \nroom for two weeks. At the end of this \nperiod, the specimens of Euglena were still \nalive because they were \nA. able to carry out holozoic nutrition \nB. able to carry out photosynthesis using \ncarbon dioxide in the pond water \nC. better adapted to life in darkness than \nto life in light \nD. not overcrowded \n \n3. The cytoplasm of the cell is considered a \nvery important component because it \nA. regulates the amount of energy in the \ncell \nB. suspends all cell organelles \nC. is the outermost part of the cell \nD. is solely responsible for cell division \n \nUse the diagram below to answer \nquestion 4 to 6 \n \n4. After an hour, the level of water in the \nthistle funnel will \nA. rise \nB. fall \nC. remain the same \nD. double \n \n5. The experiment is used to demonstrate \nthe process of \nA. transportation \nB. water culture \nC. diffusion \nD. Osmosis \n \n6. In a plant cells, the role of the \nmembrane is played by the \nA. nucleolus \nB. cell wall \nC. cytoplasm \nD. mitochondrion \n7. Red blood cells were found to have burst \nopen after being placed in distil for an \nhour. This phenomenon is known as \nA. plasmolysis \nB. diffusion \nC. haemolysis \nD. wilting \n \n8. The curvature movement of plants in \nresponse to the stimulus of water is \ncalled \nA. hydrotropism \nB. geotropism \nC. Phototropism \nD. thigmotropism \n \n9. The overall reaction in glycolysis can be \nsummarised as \nA. C  6111205 --K31-1403 + 4H + \nATP B. C6H1206 ----- 2;11403+ 4H + \n2ATP C. C61-1,206---.> 2;1-1403 + 4H \n+ ADP D. C6F11206 2C31-1403+ 4h + \n2ADP \n \n10. The longest bone in the body is the \nA. humerous \nB. femur \nC. scapula \nD. tibia \n \n11. Which of the following structures is not \na skeletal material? \nA. Chitin \nB. Cartilage \nC. Bone \nD. Muscle \n \n12. The reason why the flow of blood \nthrough the capillaries is very slow is",
