Materialists can be found \nA. in capitalist countries \nB. in communist countries \nC. in less developed countries \nD. among people who do not have neighbours. \nE. all over the world. \n \nV \nTypical Zacharia! Devil-may care and irrevererant as ever. \nNo doubt he was just the same when he was cook to a Greek \ntrader in the town. In fact, I suspect that to him the Reverend \nFather is just another sort of trader. Conceited ass, thinking \nhimself superior to the Father! And in what is he superior? \nSuccess with women, perhaps? Zacharia knows that they all \nadmire him and is always striving for still more admiration. He \ndresses sharply and walks in a haughty manner that suits his \ntallness. And then he feeds his pride on the swarms of girls who \nrun after him. It\u2019s maddening to think how little you need to \nattract them. I remember my mother coming home from market in \nthe town, after selling her vegetables and cocoa. How indignant \nshe was: \u2018It\u2019s so shameful,\u2019 she cried, \u2018our best -looking and \nmost respectable girls go to town and throw themselves at \nstrangers as ugly as sin, speaking the most outlandish tongues. \nMen I can sc arely look at without shuddering! And why? Just \nmoney! Money! Ah, what a world! And my father replied in a \nburied voice, \u2018It\u2019s the times!\u2019 \u2018The times!\u2019 shouted mother, \u2018can \nyou imagine my child Ann with creatures like those?\u2019 \nBut perhaps the girls who chase Zacharia aren\u2019t drawn \nby his tallness or his leather shoes. Perhaps they\u2019re only after \nchildish things, a bit of bread or a pot of jam, knowing that he\u2019s \na cook. My father often says women are like children in their \ndesires. And after all, I too can boast a little. Plenty of women \nturn to look at me, especially when I\u2019m dressed all in white! But \nI\u2019m not vain enough to fuss over a little thing like that. Not like \nZacharia, who doesn\u2019t know women are simply children. \n \n21.
