Assumptions are the \nfoundation upon which interpretation and \nconclusion are built. Everything in life operate \nunder certain assumptions. \nWe make management decisions based on the \nassumptions we hold about how management \nought to function and how people ought to be \ngoverned. For some of us, we consciously \nimbibe assumptions and principles about life \nand consciously decide based on them; for \nothers, it is unconsciously but potent all the \nsame. Our assumptions will either drown us or \nhelp us soar through life. \n \nWe have always seen life as an immense \nmansion with many rooms. Some rooms lead \nto wealth, others to the opposite. Ultimately, \nwe decide where we end up; and life, thus far, \nhas proved that not everyone of us decides \nwell, we all behave differently where we have \ndifferent levels of understanding, and behave \nthe way where our understanding is the same. \nWe eat because we all understand the \nconsequences of not eating. We all wear \nclothes because each of us comprehends \nlunacy. The list goes on and on. It is inevitable \nthat some of us will make choices that get and \nkeep us on the lower rung of the ladder by \nreason of exposure, training or some others \nvariables. Life is about role playing. We choose \nour roles wisely or foolishly, consciously or \nunconsciously. Some of us get wiser to new \nlevels of self-awareness enough to redefine our \nroles, others make no effort to build further \ncapacity and therefore remain where they are. \nIt is based on those realities that we draw the \nconclusion that not everyone will be wealthy in \nlife. We lead, inspire and motivate people to \nstrive and succeed. It is also important that we \npaint the full and true picture of life so that we \ncan discourage vain pursuits. Balance must be \nenthroned as a critical component of truth, and \npeople know, for instance, that \u2018the top\u2019 is not \na place that all must ascend. \n \nOur greatest consolation lies in our deep \nconviction that true prosperity is in fulfillment \nthrough hard work than in intangible \nacquisition. There are set roles that some of us \nhave been wired up to play in life but which we \nare not content enough to play because society \nesteems such roles to be inferior. Take the \nalmost scared office of a teacher for instance; \nthere are people who have the natural gifts and \ninclinations to be school teacher. But teaching \nprofession, as it is, does not appear to be \nlucrative. So we have people who could have \nbeen more fulfilled and effective working as \nschool teacher serving in banks. \n \n11. According to the writer, people lead and \nmotivate others because they want to \n(a) project individual contribution \n(b)encourage selfless service \n(c) make the world a home \n(d) prevent empty search \n \n12. According to the passage, balance must be \nenthroned because it is \n(a) a critical interdependent function \n(b) an amazing help for conscience \n(c) a critical part of fidelity",
