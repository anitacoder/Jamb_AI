With open-ended questions the \n\u202616\u2026(A. method B. responses C. errors D. conclusions) have \nto be classified into relatively small number of groups. The \nprocess of classifying answers and of sometimes identifying \nthem by number and letter is called \u202617.. (A. encoding B. \nrecording C. coding D. recoding ). When closed -ended \nquestions are used, it is possible to code all the possible answers \nbefore they are actually received. This is called\u202618.. (A. recoding \nB. coding C. precoding D. encoding). What is done, a check \nthrough the answers for proper classification, numbering and \nlettering is still called for at this stage. This whole process of \nchecking through questionnaires and notebooks is called \u202619.. \n(A. listing B. posting C. editing D. auditing). Collected data will \neventually have to be used in drawing \u202620.. (A. analogies B. \nexamples C. references D. conclusions) and writing a report \nabout the population from which it came. \n \nRead the passage below carefully and answer the questions that \nfollow. Each question carries 3 marks. \n \nPASSAGE IV \nBy 1910, the motorcar was plainly conquering the \nhighway. The private car was now part of every rich man\u2019s \nestablishment, although its prices made it as yet an impossible \nluxury for most of the middle class. But for the adventuresome \nyouth, there was the motorcycle, a fearsome invention producing \naccidents and ear \u2013splitting noises. Already, the dignified \ncarriages and smart pony -traps were beginning to disappear \nfrom the roads, and coachmen and grooms, unless mechanically \nminded, were finding it more difficult to make a living. \nThe roads, which had gone to sleep since the coming of \nthe railway, now awoke to feverish activity. Cars and motorcycles \ndashed along them at speeds which rivaled those of the express \ntrains, and the lorry began to appear. Therefore, the road system \nwas compelled to adapt itself to a volume and speed of traffic for \nwhich it had never been intended. Its complete adaptation was \nimpossible; but the road surface was easily transformed and, \nduring the early years of the century, the dustiness and \ngreasiness of the highways were lessened by tar -spraying. To \nwiden and straighten the roads and get rid of blind corners and \nevery steep gradient were tasks which had scarcely been tackled \nbefore 1914. The situation was worst of all in towns where not \nonly was any large scheme of road widening usually out of the \nquestion, but also where crowding and danger were all too \nfrequently increased by the short-sighted eagerness of town \nauthorities in laying down tramlines. \nYet it was not only the road system that was in need of \nreadjustment; the nervous system of those who used and dwelt \nby the roads suffered. The noises caused by the conversion of \nthe roads into speedways called for a corresponding tightening \nup of the nerves; and, especially in the towns, the pedestrians \nwho wished to preserve life and limb was compelled to keep his \nattention continually on the stretch, to practise himself in \nestimates of the speed of approaching vehicles and to run or \njump for his life if he ventured off the pavement. \nAdapted from Rachel Carson: The Advent of the Motor Car \n \n21. The writer seems to suggest that \nA. the volume and speed of traffic on the roads \nincreased with the advent of cars, motor cycles \nand lorries \nB. there were no roads before the advent of cars \nand motorcycles and so people had to be \nmechanically minded \nC. coachmen and grooms werenot mechanically \nminded \nD. the roads that existed were dormant. \n22. The writer uses the expression unless mechanically \nminded to refer to \nA. town authorities laying down tramlines \nB. coachmen and grooms who chose to become \nmechanics \nC. coachmen and grooms adaptable to the new \ntechnology  \nD. those amenable to change and development. \n23. The statement By 1910, the motor car was plainly \nconquering the highway means that \nA. highway codes for motor cars came into effect by \n1910 \nB. by 1910 motor cars became a common sight \non the highways \nC. the motor car was invented in 1910 \nD. by 1910 many people knew how to drive \nmotorcars. \n24. From the passage, it is obvious that \nA. the motorcar and the lorry came to displace \nthe train traffic \nB. motorcars were mere luxuries which many \npeople \ntried desperately to acquire \nC. the motorcar was invented before the express \ntrains \nD. the train was the fastest means of transport \nbeforethe motorcar and the lorry. \n25.  One of the following statements can be deducted from \nthe passage. \nA. Significant improvement occurredin road transport since \nthe advent of motorcars, lorries and motorcycles. \nB. People no longer used trains with the advent of \ncars and lorries. \nC. Society would be better off without the chaotic volume \nand speed of motor cars, lorries and motorcycles. \nD. Human society was static without the express \nspeed of cars and motorcycles. \n \nLEXIS, STRUCTURE AND ORAL FORMS \n(Questions 26 to 80 carry 1 mark each.) \nIn questions 26 and 27, identify the word that has a different \nstress pattern from the others. \n26. A. administrative B. circulation \nC. temperamental D. consideration \n \n27. A. classroom B. programme \nC. brother D. July \nIn each of questions 28 to 31, choose the word that does not \nhave the same vowel sound as the others. \n \n28. A. \nC. \nbale \nsaint \nB. \nD. \nplait \ngate \n29. A. \nC. \n \nrice \ngranite \nB. \nD. \n \nfight \ndie \n30. A. \nC. \nwind \neven \nB. \nD. \npeople \nkey \n31. A. \nC. \nenjoy \ntoil \nB. \nD. \nlog \nrejoice \nIn each of questions 31 to 56, fill each gap with the most \nappropriate option from the list provided.",
