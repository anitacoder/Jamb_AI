One suspects \nthat the reason why some of our newspapers still manage to \nbreak even is because of the great amount of revenue they derive \nfrom obituaries. It is not unusual for about one quarter of the \nvolume of an average daily to be constituted of obituaries and \nin memoriam alone. One possible e xplanation for this, it has \nbeen argued, is that Nigerians value their dead greatly. And \nthere is a saying amongst us that you do not say evil things \nagainst the dead. This is obviously the philosophy behind the \nlarge dose of encomiums with which our dead are bestowed. \nFrom the evidences of these obituaries and In memoriam, every \ndead Nigerian must have been something of a saint while alive. \nThis would explain why the death of most Nigerians is attributed \nto the evil machinations of the wicked. Only very few people in \nour country die natural death, and even when they do, the \nobituaries etc. always give the impression that such deaths \nconstitute the saddest loss to befall the deceased\u2019s family. And \nthat is why writers of these obituaries and their allied \nadvertisements are experts on \u2018mortuary stylistics\u2019. This \n\u2018mortuary stylistics\u2019, the study in the art of eulogizing the dead \nand making their loss sound so heart breaking, is one of the \ncommodities we can export to other countries. \n1. The tone of this passage  is \nA. angry B. satirical C. non-commital D. pleasant. \n2. Mortuary \u2018stylistics\u2019 as used in the passage refers to the \nA. art of writing obituaries B. text of obituaries \nC.  study of obituaries D. art of eulogizing the dead.",
