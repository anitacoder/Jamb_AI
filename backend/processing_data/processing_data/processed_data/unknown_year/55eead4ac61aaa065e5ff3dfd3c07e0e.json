Part of these \nstruggles and processes have become more \npronounced in the third world since the end of \nthe east west cold war in the late 1980s, and in \nthe face of the challenges being posed by the \nongoing process of globalization. \n \nWhile political and social changes may \nappear to be distinct phenomena, they are \nanalytically inseparable. Political and social \nchanges refer to alteration or transformations \nin human behaviour, norms and politico-social \ninstitutions. Such changes are often a collective \nresponse to the need to change, or as a tacit \nrecognition of a shift in the prevalent power \nrelations in the society. Therefore, the coming \nto power of new sets of rulers, or the \nestablishment of new structures and processes \nof governance broadly typifies socio-political \nchanges. \n \nIt is important to note that change can \neither be positive or negative. In most cases, \npolitical and social changes are caused by \ncertain factors or reasons. These push people \nto collectively organize themselves to struggle \nfor a change in the existing power relations. \nAnother reason is to capture political power, in \nthe hope of making life better for the generality \nof the people. If politics is defined as who gets \nwhat, when and how; it then implies that \npolitical change refers to an alteration in the \nform of power, and the identity of the group or \nclass which controls and wields state power \nAdapted from Anifowose, R. and Enemuo, F.

Complication \n \nPASSAGE II \nLike all reptiles, snakes are cold-blooded, \nor more correctly, ectodermic- they cannot \nproduce their own body heat; instead, they rely \non the sun to heat their bodies. Because they \ndo not rely on energy from food to generate \nbody heat; snakes can survive on an extremely \nmeager diet. Some wait for months between \nsuccessive meals and a few survive by eating a \nlarge meal just once or twice a year. When \nthey do eat, snakes swallow their prey whole \nrather than biting off small pieces.
