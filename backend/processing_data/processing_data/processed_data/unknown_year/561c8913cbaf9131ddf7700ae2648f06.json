  "content": "Use of English 1986  \n \n \n \nCOMPREHENSION \n \nRead each passage carefully and answer the questions that \nfollow \n \nPASSAGE 1 \nIt is customary nowadays among fashionable ladies and \ngentlemen to acquire strange and sometimes quaint clothes \nwhich are scarcely ever used. Sometimes it may be an \napproaching festival, sometimes a two hour ceremony and \nsometimes to honour a dead colleagu e \u2013 something triggers off \nthe modern craze to sew new materials whose use does not \noutlast the moment of craze. And so, people who just occupy \nsmall apartments in their parent homes, or have rented one room \nin a densely -people house find that more than two-thirds of \ntheir rooms are filled with bongo trousers which they cannot \nwear, worn out jeans which stink, or specially made cloth for \noccasions that are not recurrent. \nAlthough plagued by the problem of school fees for their \nchildren, parents have had to swallow their own phlegm and \nhumour their children who need special clothes for important \nevents. Newly employed youths soon find that their comrades \nare getting married, and a new and special attire must be used to \ngrace the occasion. University students see matriculation \nceremonies or induction ceremonies into club membership as \nspecial reasons to make new attire which \u2013 you may be sure \u2013 \nthey would not wear on another occasion that parallels the one \nfor which these clothes were made. \nMedical doctors may soon find another cause for the \nincidence of high blood pressure among the youth. \u2018The desire \nto acquire new clothes\u2019 is one strong possible cause, but a more \nsubtle one which haunts like a ghost is the problem of choice of \nwhat to wear. The youths have so suffered their apartments, \nwardrobes, drawers and trunks with so many clothes that the \ngreatest problem they face is the choice of what to wear. \n \n1. A suitable title for this passage is \nA. Fashion craze \nB. Fashion craze among the youth \nC. University students and induction ceremonies \nD. Parents and the money for fashion craze. \n \n2. In this passage the expression \u201cparents have had to \nswallow their own phlegm\u2019 means parents, \nA. had to swallow the sputum in their mouths \nB. have been phlegmatic all along \nC. have had to overcome their own pride or prejudice \nD. no longer had to swallow their own phlegm. \n \n3. The youth acquire clothes for \nA. burials, great occasions or for matriculation ceremonies \nB. occasions that are not recurrent \nC. boosting their ego \nD. the purpose of praising their parents. \n \n4. In this passage we learn that parents \nA. admire their children\u2019s craze for new clothes \nB. do not provide the money for the fashion craze \nC. endure alot of hardship toprovide for their children \nD. gladly provide the money for the fashion craze. \n \n5. A likely cause of high blood pressure among the youth is \nA. the clothes they wear to parties \nB. that different clothes are meant for different occasions \nC. that the youth have stuffed their wardrobes, \napartments and drawars with new clothes \nD. the thought of the choice of what to wear. \n \nPASSAGE II \nDelinquency describes actions that would not be crimes \nif performed by adults. If a young person performs one of such \nactions then he has committed a crime. Delinquency is one of \nseveral status offences \u2013 offences that can be committed only \nby people in particular stations of life as determined by age, \nprofession or a person\u2019s role in society. For young people such \noffences include drinking, driving and smoking under age. \nUsually they are offences only to the extent that they help to \npreserve some of the good things of life for the exclusive \nenjoyment of the adult world. Delinquency is therefore a weapon \nforged in adult minds and directed by adult hands against young \npeople. It is born out of envy, adult pride and intolerance. If the \nworld changed overnight and the responsibility to make and \nenforce laws fell on juvenile shoulders, the adults should expect \na raw deal in return. Delinquency would then certainly refer \nonly to many of the adult actions now freely committed by them. \n \n6. The writer of the passage believes that delinquency laws are \nA. not relevant to human society \nB. only fit for young people \nC. unfair to the juveniles \nD. very fair to the adult world. \n7. Status offences are those that can be committ \nA. all adults B. juveniles only \nC. delinquent juveniles only D. specified classes of \npeople. \n8. In theview of the writer, drinking under age is an offence \nbecause \nA. adults want to have all he drink to themselves \nB. adults do not want juveniles to get drunk \nC. drunken juveniles can cause disorder in society \nD. adults have a duty to protect young persons. \n9. If the world changed overnight \nA. there would be more delinquency laws \nB. delinquency would refer to all adult actions \nC. delinquency would no more be a crime \nD. delinquency would also change in meaning. \n10. When young people make and enforce laws \nA. the responsibility will be too heavy on their \nshoulders \nB. they would retaliate against the adults \nC. their laws will be very juvenile \nD. the world will be turned upside down.",
