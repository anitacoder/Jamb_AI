Consider the child who \ngrasps a burning coal, he has learned the hard \nway through the painful experience, but his \nfingers will remain burnt. Thus, the saying, that \nexperience is the best teacher, may not be \njustifiable after all. \nAdapted from Sunday Tribune, July 2007 \n \n11. The attitude of the writer of the passage \ncan best be described as \n(a) objective \n(b) critical \n(c) non-committal \n(d) emotional \n \n12. It can be deduced from the passage that \n(a) all experiences are best teachers \n(b) learning through pains in better \n(c) experience is superior to wisdom \n(d) wise thoughts are more desirable than \nexperience \n \n13. Which of the following states is true \naccording to the passage? \n(a) man must make mistake in order to survive \n(b) The totality of our actions should be \ndecided by our judgement \n(c) If we do not make mistakes, experience \nmust be our teacher \n(d) Our future would be judged by our past \nmistakes \n \n14. According to the passage, we be disciplined \nto \n(a) make experience our best teacher in reality \n(b) learn from experience in future \n(c) chose the learning opportunity that comes \nour way \n(d) decide against making experience our \nteacher \n \n15. The phrase a complete and wholehearted \ndevotion, as used in the passage, means \n(a) acting without doubt \n(b) learning with tension \n(c) learning without pains \n(d) teaching with ease \n \nPASSAGE IV \nThe passage below has gaps numbered 16 to \n25. Immediately following each gap, four \noptions are provided. Choose the most \nappropriate options for each gap. Each \nquestion carries 3 marks \nThe medical definition of miscarriage is the \nspontaneous loss of a pregnancy before \ntwenty-four weeks. Miscarriage is very \ncommon, occurring in ten to twenty per cent, \nof conformed pregnancies. Most of these \nfeature \u202616\u2026 [A. In the penultimate B. In the \nfirst C. around D. For] twelve week of \npregnancy. The most common \u202617\u2026 [A. type \nB. Cause C. Period D. Symptom] is vaginal \nbleeding, which can range from light spotting \nto heavier than a period. You may see blood \nclots, brown discharge or other tissues that are \nnot \u202618\u2026 [A. clearly B. naturally C. directly D. \nMedically] identifiable. Sometimes a sac-like \nstructure is seen. Often, there is cramping with \npelvic or back pain. You may find that the usual \nsymptoms of pregnancy, such as breast \ntenderness, feeling sick and having to pass \nurine more \u202619\u2026 [A. painfully B. frequently C. \ngradually D. Commonly] than usual stop \nunexpectedly. Sometimes there are no signs or \nsymptoms of miscarriage and pregnancy \nsymptoms continue, and the miscarriage is \nonly \u202620\u2026 [A. prevented B. managed C. \ndiscovered D. Stopped] in a routine scan. \nAbout half of all early miscarriages happen \nbecause of a problem in the way the genetic \nmaterial from the egg and sperm have \ncombined during \u202621\u2026 [A. pregnancy B. \nincubation C. mating D. Fertilization]. It can be \ndifficult to find out why this has \u202622\u2026 [A. \noccurred B. enlarged C. continued D. \nemerged], but it is more likely to be due to \nrandom chance than to any underlying problem \nwith either parent.
