  "content": "7.  What is the major weakness of training students for \nspecific technologies? \nA. It trains students for only one type of career. \nB. It helps students to acquire money later when they \nare employed. \nC. It makes them anxious for a job in the market \nD. It cannot help students to cope with the rapid \nchanges in the world. \n \n8. \u2018We sense in our students a narrowing materialism\u2019 \nmeans that our students\u2019 concept of education is one that \nA. prepares them for money, joy and meaning \nB. makes them ready to confront the depressed \njob market \nC. only prepare them to acquire material comforts \nD. trains them for a life-long career. \n \n9. According to the writer, a study of the humanities \nA. is accepted by present day students as essential \nB. prepares students for specific careers \nC. provides a missing link in the technological \neducation of our students \nD. is the best solution to the problem of \nunemployment. \n \n10. What type of education does the writer advocate for \nour students? \nA. Vocational as well as technological education \nB. Business, engineering, medicine and computer \nprogramming. \nC. Technological education plus the humanities. \nD. Technological education only. \n \nPASSAGE III \nOne fact that we have to comprehend is that, in our \nunconscious mind, we cannot distinguish between a wish and a \ndeed. We are all aware of some of our illogically dreams in which \ntwo completely opposite statements can exist side by side \u2013 \nvery acceptable in our dreams but unthinkable and illogical in \nour walking state. Just as our unconscious mind cannot \ndifferentiate between the wish to kill somebody in anger and the \nact of having done so, the young child is unable to make this \ndistinction. The child who angrily wishes his mother to drop \ndead for not having gratified his needs will be traumatized greatly \nby the actual death of his mother \u2013 even if this event is not \nlinked closely in time with his destructive wishes. He will always \ntake part of or the whole of the blame for the loss of his mother. \nHe will always say to himself \u2013 rarely to others \u2013 \u2018I did it. I am \nresponsible. I was bad, therefore mummy left me.\u2019 It is well to \nremember that the child will react in the same manner if he loses \na parent by divorce, separation or desertion. \nDeath is often seen by a child as an impermanent thing \nand has therefore little distinction from a divorce in which he \nmay have an opportunity to see a parent again. \n11. This passage emphasizes \nA. a child growing up in ignorance \nB. our unconscious mind \nC. a child\u2019s inability to distinguish between \ndream and reality \nD. illogical dreams. \n \n12. Our unconscious minds and dreams are alike in that \nA. both are out of our control \nB. both can accommodate contradictions \nC. neither functions in a continuous manner \nD. both deal with non-real issues. \n \n13. The child would feel responsible for his mother\u2019s death \neven if it is unconnected with his wishes because \nA. he regards his wish as a curse \nB. he hates her and wants her deaf \nC. his needs are not gratified \nD. he cannot distinguish between wish and reality. \n \n14. \u2018Traumatized\u2019 as used in the passage means \nA. angered \nB. made happy and satisfied \nC. made sad and dejected \nD. made to feel guilty. \n \n15. From the child\u2019s point of view, in what way is death to a \ndivorce? \nA. Both are losses \nB. Both are temporary \nC. Both would involve his mother \nD. He feels responsible in each case. \n \n \nPASSAGE IV \nUndergraduate students in psychology and education \ncome to their first course in statistics with diverse expectations \nof and backgrounds in mathematics. Some have considerable \nformal training and quantitative aptitude and look forward to \nlearning statistics. Other \u2013 perhaps the majority, including some \nof those who aspire to postgraduate studies \u2013 are less confident \nin their quantitative skills. They regard a course in statistics as a \nnecessary evil for the understanding or carrying out of research \nin their fields, but an evil nonetheless. \nThis third edition, like this predecessor, is directed \nprimary at the latter audience. It was written with the conviction \nthat statistical concepts can be described simply without loss of \naccuracy and that understanding of statically techniques \nresearch tools can be effectively promoted by discussing them \nwithin the context of their application to concrete data rather \nthan as pure abstractions. Further, its contents are limited to \nthose statically techniques that are widely used in the literature \nof psychology and to the principles underlying them. \nThe changes that have been made in this edition reflect \nboth the results of our teaching experience and the increasing \nprominence being given by statisticians to certain topics. Thus \nour discussions of some procedures, particularly those in the \nrealms of descriptive statistics, which students grasp easily, \nhave been shortened or rearranged. The treatment of other topics \nhas been expanded. Greater emphasis has been placed on \nsampling theory, hypothesis testing, and the notion of statistical \npower. \n \n16. The book discussed in this passage is about \nA. psychology and education \nB. mathematics for undergraduate students. \nC. quantitative skills for postgraduate studies \nD. statistical procedure relating to research. \n \n17. The expression, \u2018necessary evil\u2019 means that",
