Which of the following statements is (are) NOT \ntrue about the emission of photoelectrons from \nmetallic surfaces? \nI All metallic surfaces emit the same \nnumber of photoelectrons in a given light. \nII Most metallic surfaces in visible and \ninfrared light. \nIII A metallic surface emits photoelectric only \nif frequency of the incident light is higher \nthan its own characteristic threshold \nfrequency. \n \nA.

How would its \nrange be extended to 1.0A by placing a resistance \nof \nA. 5/ Ohms in parallel \n \n \n50. Fig 8 above represents an insulated cylindrical coil \nor copper wire wound round a paper tube. The \nends of the coil are connected to a sensitive \ngalvanometer. When a magnet was plunged into \nthe coil it was observed that the galvanometer \nneedle gave a deflection. Which of the following \ncorrectly describes this experiment? \n \nA. The effect illustrated is induced \nelectromotive force. \nB. The strength of the current produced is \ninversely proportional to the speed with \nwhich the magnet is plunged into the coil. \nC. The direction of the current is always \nsuch as to enhance the change producing \nit. \nD. The galvanometer gave a permanent  \nB. 9 \n5 Ohms in series deflection. \nC. 45 Ohms in parallel \nD. 45 Ohms in series \nE. 9/ Ohms in parallel. \nE. On removing the magnet from the coil the \ngalvanometer deflected in the same \ndirection. \n \n \n  Physics 1985  \n \n \n \n1. Which of the following is NOT a fundamental S.I. \nunit? \nA. Metre B.
