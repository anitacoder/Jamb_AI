  "content": "him in the business of keeping alive. In the \nprimitive situation, man was, therefore, \nbasically against nature but, as the battle was \nprogressively won, conscience crept in; the \nawareness of responsibility, and a failure to \nmeet it, produced feelings of guilt. \nThose who live in cities and need no longer do \nbattle against nature are nowadays most \nactively for nature. At this time, something like \na thousand kinds of animals (vertebrate \nanimals) can be said to be in danger of \nextinction. A few of them have been reduced to \nthis precarious position by extensive killing but \nthe majority are disappearing only as fast as \nthe particular kind of country they need for \nexistence is itself disappearing and all the \nhands of man, as often as not by mistake. \nThere are three species of turtles whose future \nsurvival is menaced by the demand for turtle \nsoup, which would hardly justify the \nextermination of a giant reptile whose family \nhas existed for 200 million years. \nLeopards are in jeopardy because of the \nfashion for their skins. As they get rarer, the \nprices rise and, as leopard skin become more \nexpensive, the demand increases. No species \ncan long survive the price of N60,000 which a \nhalf- grown baby leopard now carries on its \nskin. \nAnd crocodiles, the longest surviving reptiles, \nare now dwindling alarmingly as a result of the \nfashion in crocodile skin for ladies' handbags \nand men's shoes. The human population \nexplosion spreads mankind across the land \nsurfaces of the earth at an alarming rate. There \nwill be twice as many of us before most of us \nare dead. Does this mean no room for wild \nanimals? Of course not. \nAdapted from Peter Scott's article in Sunday Times. \n \n6. The sentence There will be twice as many of \nus before most of us are dead means (a) some \nincrease in human and animal population \ngrowth rates (b) mankind is fast spreading \nacross the earth (c) the population growth rate \nwill double before our death (d) many of us will \ndie as a result of population explosion \n7. Which of the following statements is true \naccording to the passage? (a) man kills animal \nonly when he can afford to do so. (b) man eats \nall categories of animals (c) man cannot spare \nthose animals that eat his kind (d) man poses \nthe greatest threat to nature \n8. The basic causes of the elimination of certain \nanimals from the earth include (a) a deliberate \nbattle against nature and the quest for leopard \nskin (b) man's decision to live in cities and the \ndevelopment of large farm lands (c) man's \npenchant for meat and the sale of animals for \nmeat and hides (d) extensive killing of animals \nand the fast disappearances of their favourable \nhabitats \n9. The expression when man evolved a \nconscience means when (a) man's intellect \nimproved tremendously (b) man became a \ncritical creature (c) man developed an \nawareness of right and wrong (d) man acquired \nnew habits",
