In a resonance tube experiment, a tube of fixed 5. \nlength in closed at one end and several turning \nforks of increasing frequency used to obtain \nresonance at the open end. If the turning fork with \nthe lowest frequency which gave resonance had a \nfrequency \u0192 1 and the next turning fork to give \nresonance had a frequency \u01922, find the ratio \u01922/ \u01921. \nA. 8 B. 3 \nC. 2 D. \u00bd \nE. 1/3 \n \n2.
