  "content": "9. Which of the following statements is TRUE according to \nthe passage? \nA. Running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of \nnational virtue \nB. At the national level, sport is frankly a mimic \nwarfare \nC. The most savage combative instincts are aroused \nby anyone who has played in a school football match \nD. Nations work themselves up because they tend \nto believe that sports are tests of national virtue. \n10. \u2018Mimic\u2019 as used in the passage, means \nA. comic B. silent C. imitated D. practiced \nPASSAGE III \nHis eyes widened as they fell upon something strange. \nSomething was moving slowly and cautiously along the gutter. \nThe pale yellow and brown of the snake\u2019s body glistened like a \nstream of flowing metal. By what mistake had the creature strayed \ninto this unlikely place? Impossible to say. Yet there it was; and \nits slow movements betrayed uneasiness and confusion. \nAs he watched it, his instinctive antipathy melted away. \nHe could understand so well what the snake was feeling. He \nentered into its cold, narrow intelligence and shared its angry \nperplexity. Its movements were cramped, its advance difficult, \nand it was in constant danger of slipping over the edge. Now \nand then it lay still in dull reflection, nursing a cold anger that \ncould find no vent. \nMeanwhile, the little plant bent downwards by every puff \nof wind, was beating its thin twigs against the gutter like a birch. \nThe snake seemed not to see the plant. It moved forward until a \nlight touch from the twigs fell upon its head. At this, it stopped \nand lifted its neck. The little plant was now doing no more than \nlightly sway and dip. The snake, its head still reared, waited, \nflickering tongue. One could feel the angry heaving and straining \nin the sluggish brain-the dull red anger waiting to explode. Then \ncame a strong gust sweeping along the wall, and at once the \ntwigs thrashed down upon the furious head-thrashed down and \nbeat it with a movement that seemed to Osun both comic and \ndreadful: in a flash, the head reared itself higher, the neck drew \nback, and there was a lunge at the twigs and the empty air. O \nfatal act! To strike, the snake had been obliged to coil, and its \ncoiled body could not support itself upon the narrow ledge. No \nrecovery was possible; it overbalanced and fell with a thud upon \na small flat roof fifty feet below. There, Osun saw the creature \nbegin to writhe in agony. It could do not more than twist and \nturn upon the same spot. \nOsun was trembling, but beneath his agitation there \nwas a deep, troubled wonder. Here was the little pla nt now \nwaving with a kind of jaunty cynicism. And there was the snake \nwrithing in agony. The world, unquestionably, was a place of \nmystery and horror. This was revealed in the writhing of the \ncrippled snake and in the jaunty waving of the innocent plant n \nthe wind. \n11. The snake was referred toas\u2018something strange\u2019 because the \nA. movement of the snake along the gutter was \nslow and cautious \nB. movement of the snake betrayed strange \nuneasiness and confusion \nC. colour of the snake\u2019s body was an unusual \nstream of flowing metal \nD. environment in which the snake was found \nwas unusual \n \n12. As the narrator watched the snake, his feeling changed \nto those of \nA. anger and apathy \nB. antipathy and perplexity \nC. perplexity \nD. angry bewilderment. \n \n13. The act of the snake was described as \u2018fatal\u2019 because the \nsnake\u2019s attack was going to \nA. be fatal to the plant \nB. make the coiled body not to support itself upon \nthe narrow ledge \nC. result in the crippling of the snake \nD. result in no possible recovery. \n \n14. Which of the following statements is NOT true according \nto the passage? \nA. Osun was not an active observer in the combat \nbetween the snake and the little plant. \nB. The moves of the little plant during the \nencounter  with the snake were not voluntary. \nC. The attack of the plant during the combat was \nentirely to blame for the fall of the snake. \nD. During the combat, the behaviour of the plant \ncould be likened to that of a human being. \n \n15. The \u2018fight\u2019 between the plant and the snake was \nprompted by \nA. the plant B. Osun C. the wind D. the snake \n \n \nPASSAGE IV \nIn the past, famine, various types of diseases, and \nnatural disasters checked population growth in many countries. \nAt that time, man had not learnt to till the soil sufficiently to \nimprove and increase her yield. Man was unable to do much to \nconquer these diseases; and natural disasters were regarded as \na curse of the gods for which man had no answer. Thus, famine, \ndiseases, and natural disasters remained a nightmare to mankind. \nWith the present developments in  technology  and modern \nagriculture, one would have thought that the problem of \nstarvation should have been solved. But starvation still stares \nman in the face. The increase in population now accounts for \nthe consequent scarcity of food experienced in many parts of \nthe world. However, in some countries, man\u2019s advancement in \ntechnology and medicine has rapidly increased the population \nwhile improved methods of agriculture and food preservation \nhave caused a steady rise in food production. Also, man can \nnow effectively prevent and cure most diseases in the world. \nUnfortunately, the working population engaged in \nagriculture is so small that it cannot produce enough to satisfy \nthe gaping mouths to be fed. In various parts of the world, man \nhas engaged himself in various jobs in order to adjust the food \nproduction to match the growing population of his zone, but \npopulation growth continues to outstrip food production \nmeasures. Incidentally, the source of food and food preservation \nmeasures can be limited unlike population growth which may \nnot be effectively checked. Perhaps the only effective checks to \npopulation explosion may be the drastic birth control measures. \nBut many religious sects the world over are opposed to many of \nthese birth control measures.",
