Which of the following captures the writer\u2019s suggestion \non how the Eagles could improve their performance in \nsubsequent matches? \nA. Better goalkeeping, a better attack \nand a stronger midfield. \nB. Replacement of injured players, stronger \nattackers and a rugged defence. \nC. Good coaching, more strikers and more \ndefenders. \nD. Fair officiating, good goalkeeping and fast \nplayers. \n \n7. A suitable title for this passage is \nA. African Teams in the 2002 World Cup \nB. The FIFA Korea/Japan 2002 \nC. The Nigerian and the Senegalese Teams \nD. The Eagles in World Cup 2002. \n \n8. From the argument in the last paragraph, it can be \nconcluded that the Eagles were \nA. more experienced than the Senegalese team \nB. not as strong as the Senegalese team. \nC. more timid and goal-shy than their opponents \nD. not sure of getting to the next round of the \ntournament. \n \n9. The word debutants, as used in the passage, means \nA. hard-fighters B. under-dogs C. first-timers D. giant killers. \n \n10. From the passage, it can be concluded that the writer \nA. was optimistic about the chances of the Eagles \nB. did not fancy the Eagles\u2019 chances \nC. was non-committal about the chances of the \nEagles \nD. was certain about the Eagles\u2019 chances. \nThis shocking defeat of France had raised Africa\u2019s \nhopes of going beyond the first round of the tournament. So \nwhen the Super Eagles of Nigeria filed out against Argentina on \nthe morning of Sunday, June the second, 2002, many Nigerian \nfootball enthusiasts delayed attending church service to watch \nthe match live on television. As expected, the Super Eagles put \nup strong resistance to the Argentinian challenge and the day \nwould not have ended on a somber note for Nigerians if the \nmomentum had been sustained throughout the match. \nThe hope of going beyond the first round, though \nprecarious, was very much alive as the Eagles were expected to \ndefeat their next opponents, Sweden and England. But some \nshortcomings in the Nigerian national team needed to be rectified \nto brighten their chances against their next opponents. \nFirst, the defence needed to be strengthened to prevent \nthe opponents from incessantly terrorizing the goalkeeper. Then \nthe strikers also needed to improve on their lackluster performance \nagainst Argentina, since every Nigerian expected them to \noverwhelm their next opponents in the opening rounds. Lastly, \nrather than gamble with unfit players, a more creative use of the \nreserves would be necessary to smooth the way to the next \nround. \nIf World Cup debutants, Senegal ,could nurse the hope \nof playing in the knock-out stages of the tournament, then the \nPASSAGE III \nAttitudes towards the smoking of cigarettes and the \nconsumption of alcohol may be used to illustrate typical African \nethics. Apart from the fact that smoking has now been linked \nwith lung cancer disease, the African moralist has always \nregarded smoking as an indication of moral degradation. A \nnumber of people have accepted the moralist idea on smoking. \nSome have refrained from smoking, and those who could \ninfluence others, such as parents and religious leaders, have \nalso exerted their influence to prevent others from smoking. On \nthe other hand, a good many people have remained indifferent \nto the moralist view and have continued to smoke. The same \nargument has been applied to the consumption of alcohol. The \nAfrican moralist, basing his judgement on the behaviour of a \nfew alcoholics, tends to regard the habit of taking alcohol as a \nsign of wretchedness. The moralist holds the view that anybody \nwho forms the habit of consuming alcohol will never do well in \nlive. While this may be true in respect of a few people in the \nsociety, the fear of the moralist has not been justified. However, \nthe economics is primarily interested in the habit of smoking and \nthe consumption of alcohol in so far as they give satisfaction to \nsmokers and drinkers and so generate supply of and demand for \ntobacco and alcohol. The economist is interested in knowing \nhow many packets of cigarettes are consumed and to what extent \nan increase or fall in consumption could affect production, that",
