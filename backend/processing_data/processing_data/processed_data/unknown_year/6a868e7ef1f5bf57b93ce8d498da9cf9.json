Jim ran into the station. \nThe 4.30 train was about to leave. As he ran along the platform \nhe saw a girl just ahead of him. She was young -- about his age. \nHe followed her into a carriage and sat down opposite her. She \ntook out a magazine and was reading it. He took out a book and \npretended to do the same. After a minute he looked up and \nsmiled at her. She didn\u2019t smile back but gave him an encouraging \nlook. Both returned to their reading but this time she was \npretending too. \nHe found her attractive and wanted to see her again. But \nhow to arrange it?. He had an idea. He took an old envelope out \nof his pocket and wrote the following words: \u2018Hallo! My number \nis 123-4567 and my name is Jim. I would very much like to see \nyou again. Ring me at nine.\u2019 \nThe train arrived at the terminal. Without looking at the \ngirl, he handed her the envelope, or rather threw it at her, and \njumped off the train. \nWhen he got home he made himself a cup of coffee and \nwondered\u2026 perhaps she was one of those naturally friendly \npeople who smile at everybody. He was listening to the radio \nwhen the telephone rang\u2026 it was only Umaru. Nine o\u2019clock, \nthen 9;30 and no telephone call from the girl. Feeling miserable \nhe went to bed early. \nIt was a foggy morning. \u2018Hallo, is that Jim? This is Joan. \nYou\u2026\u2019 It was two minutes past nine. \n \n1. On the train Jim was \nA. reading a book B. staring at the girl \nC. pretending to read D. looking through a magazine \nE. reading a newspaper. \n \n2. He wanted to see the girl again because \nA. it was summer B. she was attractive \nC. he wanted to read her magazine D. she smiled at him \nE. they had agreed to meet. \n \n3. He hoped to arrange a date with her by \nA. writing a letter toher B. ringing her up \nC. waiting at thestation D. handing in a short notein a hurry \nE. sending a telegram. \n4. That evening he had a telephone call from \nA. his colleague, Umaru B. the girl he met on the \ntrain C. the railway authorities D. nobody at all \nE. Joan. \n \n5. The source of misunderstanding was \nA. his natural shyness B. the station clock being out of order \nC. the time given by Jim -- 9 o\u2019clock p.m.? \nD. the foggy morning E. Jim\u2019s faulty wrist watch. \n \nII \nA British electronics manufacturer has built a factory in \nwhich quartz crystals can be grown in 3 weeks. The natural \ngrowth of quartz takes 3 million years, and very often the crystals \nare not sufficiently pure to satisfy the precise needs of science. \nHowever, the manufactured crystal are exceptionally pure, and \nthis is important because quartz, in transistor, is used in an \nastonishing number of devices where constant accuracy is \nrequired: radio and television transmitters and receivers, space \nsatellites and computers are familiar examples. In order to make \nartificial quartz, very small pieces of the natural crystal imported \nfrom Brazil are placed in long, narrow, steel cylinders. A high \npressure and a high temperature are maintained within the \ncylinders for 3 weeks, and at the end of this time the small \nfragments have grown to the required weight of one pound. The \nquartz is then ready to be made into the tiny transistors that \nhave replaced the much larger thermionic valves. \n \n6. The manufactured crystals have to be pure \nA. because natural quartz is pure \nB. to maintain hygiene in factory work \nC. to satisfy the precise needs of importers. \nD. to satisfy the exact requirements of science. \nE. otherwise they would take 3 million years to grow. \n \n7. According to the passage, quartz is used \nA. only in a few devices B. in a lot of devices \nC.   in wrist watches D. for jewellery \nE. for steel cylinders. \n \n8. Artificial quartz as compared with natural is \nA. superior.   B. inferior C. just the same D. varied \nE. limited in use. \n9. Transistors have \nA. helped to produce quartz \nB. made radio and television inaccessible to the \nworking populace \nC. made transmitters and receivers smaller and lighter. \nD. retarded progress in electronics. \nE. made transmitters and receivers bigger and heavier.",
