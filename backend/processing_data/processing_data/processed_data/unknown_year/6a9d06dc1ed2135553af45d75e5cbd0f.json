  "content": "rare diseases \nD. common colds are easily not he province of the \northodox medical experts. \n \n8. According to the writer, some widely held beliefs about \nthe common colds are: \nA. inevitable B. irreconcilable C. fallacious D. \nsocietal \n \n9. From the information in the passage, there is evidence. \nA. against the theory that the common cold is infectious \nB. for the theory that the common cold is indeed \ninfectious \nC. that old people are immune against the common \ncold \nD. that medical reports are silent on facts about common \ncolds. \n \n10. The Cirencester volunteers kept a record of their colds \nthrough \nA. the British Medical Journal B. morbidity rates \nC.  temperature recordings. D. personal diaries. \n \nPASSAGE III \nYoung men have strong passions, and tend to gratify \nthem indiscriminately. Of the bodily desires, it is the sexual by \nwhich they are most swayed and in which they show absence of \nself-control. They are changeable and fickle in their desires, \nwhich are violent while they last, but quickly over: their impulses \nare keen but not deep -rooted, and are like sick people\u2019s attacks \nof hunger and thirst. They are hot-tempered and quick-tempered, \nand apt to give way to their anger; bad temper often gets the \nbetter of them, for owing to their love of honour they cannot \nbear being slighted, and are indignant if they imagine themselves \nunfairly treated. While they love honour, they love victory still \nmore, for youth is eager for superiority over others, and victory \nis one form of this. They love both more than they love money, \nwhich indeed they love very little, not having yet learnt what it \nmeans to be without it. They look at the good side rather than \nthe bad, not having yet witnessed many instances of \nwickedness. They trust others readily, because they have not \nyet been cheated. They are sanguine; nature warms their blood \nas though with excess of wine ; and besides that, they have as \nyet met with few disappointments. Their lives are mainly spent \nnot in memory but in expectation , for youth has a long future \nbefore it and a short past behind it: on the first day of one\u2019s life \none has nothing at all to remember, and can only look forward. \nThey are easily cheated owing to the sanguine disposition just \nmentioned. Their hot tempers and hopeful dispositions make \nthem more courageous than older men are; the hot temper \nprevents fear, and the hopeful disposition creates confidence; \nwe cannot feel fear so long as we are feeling angry, and any \nexpectation of good makes us confident. \nAristole\u2019s Youth and Old-Age, p. 197 \n11.  The expression, \u2018not in memory but in expectation\u2019, as \nused in the passage, implies \nA. innocence, not experience B. future, not present \nC. past, not present D. hopelessness, not hopefulness. \n \n12. The statement, \u2018nature warms their blood as though with \nexcess of wine\u2019, as used in the text, means \nA. act with considerable confidence and trust. \nB. respond with suspicion and alertness \nC. behave shamelessly like a drunkard \nD. move with care and self-control. \n \n13. The analogy between young men and sick people is that \nA. they are easily swayed by emotions \nB. they are easily controlled by hunger and thirst \nC. their emotions are active but short-lived \nD. they are apt to give way to anger. \n \n14. According to the passage, young men are \nA. violent when they have sexual desires \nB. active and restive until they satisfy their desires \nC. indignant and fickle in satisfying their sexual desires \nD. hot-tempered when they are hungry or thirsty. \n \n15. The writer says that young people are optimistic in \ntheir \ndealings with people because they are. \nA. steadfast B. courageous C. discreet \nD. reckless. \n \nPASSAGE IV \n \nThe passage below has gaps numbered 16 to 25. Immediately \nfollowing each gap, four options are provided. Choose the most \nappropriate option for each gap. Each question carries 2 marks. \n \nWith the most profound respect to the members of the \nSenate,  I do not  think that  it is within the competence of that \n\u202616\u2026(A. executive B. judicial C. administrative D. legislative) \nbody to pass a motion to \u202617\u2026 (A. enforce B. nullify C. modify \nD. order) the executive action  of the President. The Senate  is \n\u202618\u2026(A. a wing B. a portion C. an anchor D. an arm) of the \nNational Assembly. But it is not by itself alone the National \nAssembly. One can imagine the confusion, which would be \ncreated if the \u202619\u2026(A. House of Representatives B. Judiciary \nC. National Assembly D. Executive Council ) were to take a \nview diametrically opposed to that reflected in the Senate \nresolution. The strongest objection to the action of the Senate \nin passing the resolution is the fact that it constituted itself \nthe\u202620\u2026 (A. litigant B. defendant C. plaintiff D. attorney) as \nwell as the judge of the constitutionality of the action of the \nPresident. The function  of the Senate is to \u202621\u2026   (A. enact \nB. create C. compose D. annul) laws. But the Senate has no \nauthority or \u202622\u2026 (A. might B. power C. dynamism D. \nstrength) to control the President in the exercise of his \u202623\u2026 \n(A. official B. authoritative C. judicial D. executive) powers. It \ncannot by a mere resolution or motion give any directive to the \nPresident regarding the exercise of his powers nor can it undo \nwhat the President has done in the exercise of those powers. \nThe only way in which the exercise of the powers of the President \ncan be\u2026 24\u2026 (A. modified B. standardized C. regulated D. \nordered) is by \u202625\u2026(A. an Act B. a Decree C. a motion D. a \nbill) of the National Assembly. \nAdapted from The Guardian of July 8, 1999, p. 8 \nLEXIS, STRUCTUREAND ORALFORMS \n \n(Questions 26 to 62 carry 1 mark each.) \n \nIn each of the questions 26 to 30, choose the option that has the \nsame vowel sound as the one represented by the letters \nunderlined.",
