Alan likes country life. \n \nV \nIn1973 a Japanese sericulturist arrived in Malawi with a \nbatch of 40,000 silkworm eggs. They were taken to the Bvumbwe \nAgricultural Research Station in Thyolo District. In this station, \nwork is being done to determine favourable silkworm rearing \nconditions and areas where mulberry trees, whose leaves the \nworms feed on, could grow well. According to researchers, the \nsilkworms \u2013 which eventually develop into cocoons from which \nraw silk is produced \u2013 do well in areas with warm climatic \nconditions. \nSilk is one of the strongest of fibres. In fact, for thousands \nof years, silk fabrics have been regarded as the most beautiful \nand durable materials woven by man. Many people call silk the \n\u2018cloth of kings and queens\u2019. \nThe weaving of silk originated in China. An old Chinese \nbook, believed to be written by Confucius, tells us that the wife \nof Emperor Huang-ti was the first person to make fabrics of silk. \nAround 2640 B.C., Emperor Huang-ti asked his wife Hsi Ling- \nshih to study the worms that were destroying the mulberry trees \nin his garden. The Empress took some of the cocoons into the \npalace to see what they were made of. She dropped one of the \ncocoons into a bowl of boiling water and was amazed to see a \ncobweb-like tangle separate itself from the cocoon. She picked \nup the gauzy mass and found that one of the threads could be \nunwound almost without e nd from the cocoon. His Ling -shih \nhad discovered silk. She was delighted with the discovery and \neven wove a ceremonial robe for the Emperor out of the cocoon \nthreads. After that, the officials in the Emperor\u2019s court wore \nbrightly dyed silk robes on important occasions. \nPeople in other countries regarded the new fibres as \nsomething rare and beautiful. A few traders went to China to \nlearn about making cloth from silk, but the Chinese kept their silk \nworms a closely guarded secret. \n \n21. Sericulture is \nA. carried out only in China \nB. the breeding of silkworms for the production for silk \nC. the research done on silkworms \nD. the making of cloth from the cocoons of silkworms \nE. the breeding of silkworms in Malawi. \n \n22.

The work carried out at the Agricultural Research \nStation in Malawi on the silkworm eggs was to \nA. try to breed cocoons which would produce more silk \nB. determine the survival rate of silkworms \nC. find out the most suitable areas and conditions for \nrearing silkworms \nD. search for better method of rearing silk worms \nE. find out how cocoons become silkworms. \n \n25.
