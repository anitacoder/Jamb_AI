  "content": "A. the convergence of people from disparate \nregions \nresults in the pressure of communication. \nB. there is little demand for the indigenous \ndialects. \nC. they want a lingua franca which is produced \nby mutual intelligibility. \nD. they are made up of both rural and urban \ndwellers. \n2. According to the passage, \nA. a foreign language produces the transference \nof the correct patterns of dialect features. \nB. speech organs areshapedbyindigenouslanguages. \nC. a lingua franca is the consequence of a standard \ndialect. \nD. mutual intelligibility is the consequence of the \npressure of communication. \n3.

The word those, as used in the passage, refers to \nA. indigenous languages \nB. forms of orthography and phonology \nC. foreign languages \nD. patterns of an indigenous language. \n5. Phonetic patterns allow for intelligibility tolerance because \nA. transference is both difficult to avoid and easy to \ntolerate \nB. they are involved and difficult to avoid \nC. they give rise to the phenomenon of accent \nwhich is easy to tolerate \nD. they involve muscular patterns which later \ncrystallize. \nPASSAGE II \nIt is possible to have a glimpse of life after death. Man \nhas always believed in an afterlife, but only today do we have \nscientific reports of people who seem to have experienced the \nsensation of dying but lived to tell about it. Ongoing research is \ndocumenting hundreds of cases each year of the near \u2013death \nexperience (NDE), and scientists think they are finding a clearly \nidentifiable pattern: usually a man is dying and, as he reaches \nthe point of greatest physical distress, he hears himself \npronounced dead by his doctor. He begins to hear an \nuncomfortable noise, a loud ringing or buzzing, and at the same \ntime feels himself moving very rapidly through a long dark tunnel. \nAfter this he suddenly finds himself outside of his own physical \nbody, but still in the immediate physical environment, and he \nsees his own body from a distance, as though he is a spectator. \nHe watches the resuscitation attempt from this unusual vantage \npoint and is in a state of emotional upheaval. \nAfter a while, he collects himself and becomes \naccustomed to his odd condition. He notices that he still had a \n\u2018body\u2019, but one of a very different nature and with very different \npowers from the physical body he has left behind. Soon after, \nthings begin to happen. Others come to meet and to help him. \nHe glimpses the spirits of relatives and friends who have already \ndied, and a loving, warm spirit of a kind he has never encountered \nbefore- a being of light \u2013 appears before him. This being asks \nhim a question, nonverbally \u2013 to make him evaluate his life \u2013 and \nhelps him along by showing him a panoramic instantaneous \nplayback of the major events of his life . Then he finds that he \nmust go back to the earth that the time for his death has not yet \ncome. At this point he resists, for by now he is taken up with his \nexperiences in the afterlife and does not want to return. He is \noverwhelmed by intense feelings of joy, love and peace. Despite \nhis attitude, though, he somehow reunites with his physical \nbody and lives. \nAdapted from Moody, R. A. (1975) Life after Life \n \n6. The NDE man appears to be a spectator in the flurry of \nactivities around him because \nA. his new \u2018body\u2019 would not allow him to \nparticipate. \nB. he is moving rapidly through a long dark \ntunnel. \nC. he can only watch as the events unfold \nD. he is now a dead man. \n \n7. According to the passage, scientific evidence has made \nit possible \nA. to make conjectures about what happens after \ndeath \nB. to know a little about what happens in the \nworld of the dead \nC. for one to experience the sensation of dying \nand living again \nD. for the dead to return and tell their experiences. \n \n8. The expression as he reaches the point of greatest \nphysical distress, as used in the passage, means when \nA. the man\u2019s system finally collapses \nB. the sick man finally stops breathing \nC. his doctor is ready to pronounce him dead \nD. his condition seems to get worse. \n9. A suitable title for the passage is \nA. A Glimpse into the World of the Dead \nB. Visions of an Afterlife \nC. Research into the Lives of the Dead \nD. The Sensation of Death and the Afterlife. \n \n10. That the man was shown a panoramic instantaneous \nplayback of the major events of his life suggests that \nA. he needs to be entertained to take his mind \naway from the noise around him \nB. he needs to see the difference between his \npast life and his new life \nC. there are video machines in the world beyond \nD. he has to assess his deeds in life. \nPASSAGE III \n \nThe passage below has gaps numbered 11 to 20. Immediately \nfollowing each gap, four options are provided. Choose the most \nappropriate option for each gap. Each question carries 2 marks. \n \nBefore any detailed analysis begins, the first thing to do \nwith the raw data is to check through the field record books and \nquestionnaires for any \u202611.. (A. mistakes B. events C. records \nD. odds), inconsistencies and incompleteness. In some cases, it \nmay be possible to correct any discovered shortcomings. When \nit is not possible to carry out these \u202612\u2026 (A. plans B. \ncorrections C. expectations D. possibilities), a visit to the field \nmay even  be necessary. It should however  be realized that it is \nnot very often that a revisit is possible. \nIn most scientific \u202613\u2026 (A. questionnaires B. data C. \nexperiments D. conclusions) such revisits are clearly impossible. \nThis is true of many surveys too. A road traffic survey\u202614.. (A. \nclassified B. precoded C. conducted D. experimented) to find \nout the amount and frequency of daily traffic between two towns \ncannot be expected to be ...15... (A. observed B. produced C. \nundertaken D. reproducible). There is no way of going back \nto check whether the number of vehicles reported for any",
