The \ntitle of the \nstructured questionnaire is \u201cQHEJECEEN\u201d. \nSampled \nrespondents\n \nwere selected with descriptive sampling technique. Fifteen staff, applicants \nand students were sampled from fifteen higher institutions and their host\n \ncommunities \nin South\n-\nWestern Nigeria making a total of 225 respondents. A ten item qu\nestionnaire \nwas designed on the subject. The questionnaire is close\n \n-\n \nended which included Yes or \nNo options. The data collected was analyzed with ANOVA as the statistical tool. \n\u201cQHEJECEEN\u201d was validated by two \nPrincipal \nLecturers of the \nSchool \nof \nSecondar\ny \nEducation (Arts and Social Sciences)\n \nof\n \nThe \nCollege of Education, Lanlate and two\n \nSenior \nLecturers \nof the Department of \nHistory\n, University of Ibadan. T\n-\ntest was also used to test \ninternal validity and the reliability co\n-\nefficient of 0.81 was established\n \nwhich\n \nwas\n \nreliable \nenough to carry out the research. \n \n \nDiscussion of Results\n \n \nHo\n1:\n \nThe\nre is no significant difference\n \nbetween the efficiency of JAMB and the \nadmission of students with low grades.\n \n \nThe \nfirst hypothesis that says \nthere is no significant difference between the efficiency of \nJAMB and the admission of students with low grades is rejected\n \nas shown on Table\ns\n \n1 \nand \n2\n \n. The implication of the rejection of this null hypothesis\n \nis\n \nthat if JAMB is truly \nefficient,\n \nadmission of students with low grades would not have been allowed in the first \ninstance as this would ultimately affect students\n\u2019\n \nperformance when eventually \nadmitted.",
