It was of such a man \nshe had dreamt. He had a fine, arrogant carriage, like a soldier or \nsomeone in authority. When he reached the end of the pier, he \naddressed them in a rich, deep voice that disturbed her as the \nvoluptuous rising of the tide had done. \n\u2018You\u2019re Tunde Onu, I\u2019m told\u2019, he said to her father. \n\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 said her father. \n\u2018The bus conductor told me you take people to the islands\u2019, \ntheman continued. \u2018I\u2019d like to go there if you can take me,\u2019 \nHer father examined the man from head to foot, shrewdly \nmeasuring his capacity to pay. Then he said: \n\u2018When were you thinking of going?\u2019 \n\u2018Right away\u2019 \n\u2018That\u2019s a different story, for my boatman is gone to Badagry \nand he won\u2019t be back before nightfall. \n\u2018Oh!\u2019 said the stranger. \u2018That\u2019s too bad. You couldn\u2019t \nget someone else instead of him?\u2019 \n\u2018I would have to think hard\u2019, he said gloomily, \u2018for it\u2019s \nnot everyone would do for the job of going with me \nbeyond the bay to the islands at this time of the year\u2019 \nShola understood her father\u2019s manoeuvre and felt ashamed. \n \n1. How would you describe Shola\u2019s father? \nA. A greedy boatman \nB. An energetic but good-for-nothing man \nC. A loving father who wants to safeguard the \ninterest of his daughter \nD. A talkative fool. \n2. Which of the following is NOT true of the passage? \nA. Shola did not approve of her father\u2019s behaviour \ntowards the stranger \nB. Shola\u2019s father could row the stranger to the \nislands alone had he so wished \nC. Shola\u2019s father exaggerated the difficulties in \norder to raise his fee \nD. Shola had recently been disturbed by the tide. \n \n3. Which of thefollowing is true of thestranger in the passage? \nA. He was a proud and good looking man with a \ndeep voice that annoyed Shola \nB. He was familiar with the people of the islands \nC. He was a fine gentleman in need of help \nD. He was too proud to reciprocate Shola\u2019s love. \n \n4. \u2018Manoeuvre\u2019 in the passage means \nA. shrewdness B. cleverness C. stupidity D. strategy \n \n5. Which of the following is true of the passage? \nA. The stranger was in a bad mood \n \nB. The stranger came by bus \nC. Shola and her father were idlewhen the stranger came \nD. Shola\u2019sfather measured thestranger from head tofoot. \n \nPASSAGE II \nI am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport \ncreates goodwill among nations, and that if only the common \npeoples of the world could meet one another at football or squash, \nthey would have no inclination to meet on the battle field. even \nif one didn\u2019t know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic \nGames, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to \norgies of hatred, one could deduce it from general principles. \nNearly all the sports practiced nowadays are competitive. You \nplay to win, and the game has little meaning unless you do your \nutmost to win. On the village green, where you pick up sides \nand no feeling of local patriotism is involved, it is possible to \nplay simply for the fun of it and exercise; but as soon as the \nquestion of prestige arises, as soon as you feel that you and \nsome larger unit will be disgraced if you lose, the most savage \ncombative instincts are aroused. Anyone who has played even \nin a school football match knows this. At the international level, \nsport is frankly a mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not \nthe behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators; \nand, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves \ninto furies over these absurd contests and seriously believe-at \nany rate for short period-that running, jumping and kicking a \nball are tests of national virtue. \nEven a leisurely game demanding grace rather than \nstrength can cause much ill -will. Football, a game in which \neveryone gets hurt and every nation has its own style of play is \nfar worse. Worst of all is boxing. One of the most horrible sights \nin the world is a fight between white and coloured boxers before \na mixed audience. \n \n6. The 1936 Olympic Games was cited in the passage as an \nexample to show that sports can \nA. lead to excessive hatred \nB. create goodwill among nations \nC. generate feelings of national prestige \nD. make people meet on the battle field. \n \n7. According to the passage, \nA. all the sports practiced nowadays are competitive \nB. games have meaning only when the participants \nplay to win \nC. it is possible to play a game simply for the fun of it \nD. on the local green, you play not to win but for the fun of it. \n \n8. Boxing is regarded as the worst gamein the passagebecause \nA. of the behaviour of the boxers themselves \nB. of the amount of ill-will that can be generated \namong spectators of different races \nC. of the ill-will that can be generated by a game \nthat demands strength from the competitors \nD. it is a game in which both players get hurt rather \nbadly.",
