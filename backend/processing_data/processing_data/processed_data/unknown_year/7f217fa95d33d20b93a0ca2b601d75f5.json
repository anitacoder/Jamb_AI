  "content": "PASSAGE II \nBy the time a child has reached the age of two years, \nthe psychologist says that he is \u2018self -conscious\u2019.  This is not \nthe same as the lay use of the term, although there is a \nconnection. The psychologist means that the child is aware \nthat he is a self and not an extension of his mother. This awareness \nis shown in such behavioural acts as disobedience and the use \nof the word \u2018no\u2019 with emphasis, because the child is aware that \nhe does not have to obey parental commands. Parental \ncommands (moral imperatives) are given throughout these two \nyears first for the child\u2019s own safety e.g. \u2018Don\u2019t touch the fire \nand secondly, so that he begins to develop some sense of right \nand wrong. An adult is able to weigh the consequences of his \nactions, partly because he has developed a concept of idea of \ntime. The young child lacks this concept and is governed by \nimmediate desires which must be fulfilled. Thus in some \nsituations, he can be excused for not behaving morally, i.e., \nmaking the choice whic h is \u2018good\u2019 for himself and others. In \nother situations, he knows what is right and chooses not to do \nit. Immature adults can also behave in this self-centred way. \n \n6. The immature adult is like the child because \nA. he has just become self-conscious \nB. he has learnt to use the word \u2018no\u2019 \nC. he has no concept of time \nD. some of his actions are deliberately irrational. \n \n7. What main difference is mentioned between the child \nand the adult? \nA. Age difference B. Weight difference \nC. Time difference D. Developmental difference. \n \n8. What right has the mother to give orders to the child? \nA. She is the \u2018owner\u2019 of the child. \nB. She is stronger than the child. \nC. She understands the environment better than the child. \nD. She is more self-conscious than the child. \n \n9. The two-year old child begins to refuse orders \nA. in order to annoy his parents \nB. because he does not understand them \nC. to assert his independence \nD. because he has just learnt the new word \u2018no\u2019. \n10. What kind of awareness does the child demonstrate at two? \nA. That he does not love his mother \nB. Consciousness of all things around him \nC. That he should think of himself alone \nD. That he is different and separate from others. \n \nPASSAGE III \nIf we examine the opportunities for education of girls \nor women in less developed countries, we usually find a dismal \npicture. In some countries, the ratio of boys to girls in secondary \nschools is more than seven to one. what happens to the girls? \nOften they are kept at home to look after younger siblings and to \nperform a variety of domestic chores. Their education is not \nperceived as in any way equal in importance to that of boys. \nWhen a non-literate or barely literate girl reaches adolescence, \nshe has little  or no qualification for employment, even if her \ncommunity provides any opportunity for the employment of \nwomen. The solution is to get her married as soon as possible, \nwith the inevitable result that she produces children too soon, \ntoo often and too late. With no formal education, she is hardly \naware that there is any alternative. In a study made in Thailand, \nit was noted that the literate woman marries later and ceases \nchildbearing earlier than her non -literate counterpart. But the \nlatter is so chained to her household by the necessities of \ngathering fuel, preparing food and tending children that she is \nvery difficult to reach, even if health services, nutrition, \neducation, maternal and child health centers are available in her \ncommunity. She does not understand what they are intended to \ndo. \n(Adapted from Margot Higgins: War on Hunger). \n \n11. The phrase \u2018a dismal picture\u2019 means \nA. a dull show B. an interesting show \nC. a sad situation D. a dreadful appearance. \n \n12. According to the writer, most girls in less developed \ncountries are not in school because \nA. they refuse to be educated \nB. they prefer getting married and having children \nC. the education of boys is rated higher \nD. the girls have no employment opportunities \nafter leaving school. \n \n13. Thenon-literate woman isverydifficult to reach becauseshe \nA. does not understand the value of education \nand health services \nB. is too far from the city and from school \nC. is not permitted to go out to attend clinics for \nhealth services \nD. can only gather fuel and prepare food. \n \n14. The phrase \u2018too late\u2019 as used in the passage implies \nthat the woman \nA. ought to have started producing children earlier \nB. goes on producing children when she ought \nto have stopped \nC. fails to marry early enough for her to produce children \nD. had all her children at an advanced age. \n \n15. The writer emphasizes that in less developed countries, \nA. the education of girls is not important \nB. the non-literate woman has some advantage \nbecause she has more children \nC. theliterate female is a threat tothe male in employment \nD. there is a need to give boys and girls equal \nopportunities in education. \n \nPASSAGE IV \nThe importance of the code theory in education lies in \nthe fact that the school system requires the use of an elaborated \ncode but not all students have access to it. the importance of \nthis theory to sociology lies in the fact that the differential access \nto the elaborated code does not occur randomly but rather is \ncontrolled by the class system. Lower working-class urban \nchildren tend to have a restricted code. Middle -class children \npossess both a restricted and an elaborated code. The two \ngroups enter into different types of relationships and learn to \nexpress themselves in different ways through language. They \ndo not use language for the same functions, some of which, it \nseems, are necessary for the school situation. When the lower \nworking-class child is expected implicitly to exploit language for \nfunctions he normally does not express verbally, a discontinuity \nis created between his home and his school environment.
