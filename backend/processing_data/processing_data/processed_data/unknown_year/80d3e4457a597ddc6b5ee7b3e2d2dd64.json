Not only had it digitalized its operations, it had also pleasantly surprised \nNigerians\n \nby releasing its results with\nin\n \nthe shortest \npossible time. The Board had also \nshown serious commitment towards checking examination malpractices by descending \nheavily on perpetrators of such dastardly acts. All these were efforts \naimed at lend\ning \ncredibi\nlity\n \nto its examinations. \n \n \nHowever, higher institutions had shown that Jamb was not effi\nci\nent in carrying out its \nmandate by introducing the post U.T.M.E\n.\n \nThe \npost \nU.T.M.E.,\n \ntherefore\n,\n \nis a\n \ntacit\n \nrejection \nof JAMB\u2019s matriculation examinations which is aki\nn to a vote of no confidence.\n \n \nInterestingly enough; the North that had inadvertently contributed immensely to the \nestablishment of \nJAMB \nwith the belief that \nuniversities \nwere discriminating against\n \nnorthern candidates, still, up till now, do not have as m\nany students in \nuniversities \nas the \nsouth does. This is better understood when one considers the fact that the quota system, \nwhen introduced, was principally aimed at providing admission opportunities for \napplicants from the less \nprivileged\n \nareas especiall\ny the North.\n \nAnyawu (2016) submitted \nthat in 1978/79 a\ncademic session\n,\n \nfor instance, a total of 113, 162 candidates applied to \ndifferent universities in\n \nNigeria\n.\n \nOut\n \nof this figure, applicants from the North were less \nthan 20,000\n. Of\n \nthe total number\n \nthat applied for admission\n, only 14,417 students or 12% \nwere admitted altogether with the \nSouth \nhaving 11,641 and the North\n \nhaving 2,776. \nUnfortunately the trend continues till today.\n \n \nIt is in view of all the foregoing that the paper recommended that \nJAM\nB\n, as presently \nconstituted\n,\n \nshould be un\n-\nbundled and de\n-\ncentralized. Nigeria is a large country both in\n \nte\nr\nms of land mass and population with her youths seeking admission contributing a big \nchunk of the nation\u2019s population. For a single body to effective\nly carry out the \nresponsibility of conducting matriculation examinations for all the tertiary institutions in \nthe whole country is rather herculean indeed.\n \n \n \nNigeria is \na\n \nheterogeneous\n \nnation and there is no gainsaying the fact that higher \ninstitutions wer\ne founded, \ninter\n-\nalia\n, to stimulate the growth and development of their \nhost communities. If the input of individual institutions is not factorized in admission \nprocesses, it would affect the quality of intakes and thus compromise the aims and \nobjectives o\nf the founding fathers in establishing such an institution. It is thus suggested \nthat each \ninstitution\n \nshould be allowed a large measure of \nautonomy\n \nin its admission \nprocesses.",
