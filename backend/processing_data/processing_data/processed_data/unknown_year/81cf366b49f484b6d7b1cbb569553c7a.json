In order words, Nigerian people are \nvery religious. Most of them believe that there \nis an unseen supernatural world, apart from \nthe natural world we see around us. This other \nworld is inhabited by beings who are the source \nof our knowledge of good and evil. they watch \nand judge us and if we offend them they may \nhave to be appeased with prayers and \nsacrifices. Certain individuals in the natural \nworld-priest, prophets and diviners \u2013 are \nbelieved to be endowed with special powers to \nmake contact with the other world. These \nindividuals lay down ceremonies or rituals \nwhich must be observed if due honour is to be \npaid to the unseen beings. The religious beliefs \nand practices of Nigerians can be classified \nunder three main headings: Traditional \nreligion, Islam and Christianity. in this passage, \nour focus in on Traditional Religion. \n \nTraditional or indigenous religion continues \nto exert a strong influence on many people\u2019s \nmind partly because of its association with their \nbirth places and families. Each ethnic group has \nits own religious traditions, and these are often \nlinked to some sacred spots in the ethnic \nhomeland. Yet the various traditional religions \nhave much in common: a remote but \nbenevolent high god; under him, a number of \nlesser gods who interact with mankind; and \nbelow them various spirits who inhabit natural \nobjects (trees, streams, rocks, etc.); below \nthem again, and closest to living men and \nwomen, the spirits of the ancestors. \n \nIn Yoruba tradition, for example, there are \nmore than 400 lesser deities presided over by \nthe high god, Olorun. Because he is remote \nfrom mankind, shrines are not built to him and \nworship is not offered to him directly. The \nlesser gods, on the other hand, are the subject \nof special cults, each with its own priest and \ndevotees. Eshu, the messenger of the \nGods; Ifa, the god of divination; Shango, the \ngod of thunder, and so on. Traditional religion \nwas also strong in other parts of Nigeria. In \nigbo Traditional religion, there were fewer \ngods. Although there was a remote high god, \nthe most important figure was Ala or Ani, the \ngoddess of the earth. In Hausa land, traditional \nreligion has largely gone underground owing to \nthe influence of Islam, but belief in the \nexistence of \u2018Bori\u2018 spirits and their power to \npossess people, especially women, is strong in \nsome areas. Each spirit is associated with \ncertain type of behaviour, which is manifested \nby the possessed individual. \n \nDivination \u2013 the discovery of what is unknown \nor is yet to happen by supernatural or magical \nmeans \u2013 is an important element of traditional \nreligion. It is often one of the function \nof \u2018medicine men\u2019 or \u2018herbalists\u2019. In Igboland, \nthere also used to be several oracles which \npeople consulted in order to seek solutions to \ntheir problems. With the coming of Christianity, \ntheir influence has however waned, but in \nareas like Arochukwu and Okija, the influence \nof such oracles is still strongly felt. \n \n(Adapted from Grant, Nnamonu and Jowitt (1997), Senior \nEnglish Project: For Senior Secondary School Students) \n \n1.
