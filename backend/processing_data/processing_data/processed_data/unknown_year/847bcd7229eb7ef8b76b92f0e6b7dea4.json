A suitable title for this passage is \n(a) Nigerian Literary Writers \n(b) Nigerian Publishers and International \nAwards \n(c) Poor reading Culture in Nigeria \n(d) Why Nigerian Lecturers Sell Handouts. \n \nPASSAGE III \nIt is said that experience is the best teacher, \nbut to learn consciously through wisdom may \neven be a better and more convenient way. To \nlearn by experience is to learn from mistakes. \nIt means you have burnt your fingers and now \n\u2018your eyes are open\u2019. This is a tough, costly \nand inconvenient way to learn. Rather than \nleaving our learning to experience, why do we \nnot learn consciously through wisdom? We can \nlearn by consciously going out of our way to \nacquire knowledge and wisdom rather than \nleave our learning to chance. Surely, we can \nlearn from mistakes but why wait till when we \nmake mistakes before we learn? We should \ngive more premium to learning by wisdom than \nby experience. \n \nThis will involve one making up ones\u2019 mind \nto be decisive in learning. We must decide to \nlearn consciously and not necessarily from \nnegative experiences. The first step is to realize \nthat life is simply the outcomes and outplay of \ndecisions. Our life now is the sum total of our \ndecisions and our future will be determined by \nour decision of today. If we decide to learn \ntoday, we are not likely to make mistakes and \nwhen we do not make mistakes. Experience \nneed not to be our best teacher. \n \nTo avoid making experience our best teacher \nwill take more than a decision. We must couple \nour decision with a complete and wholehearted \ndevotion. We must be resolved, resolute and \nresilient in our bid to learn by wisdom and not \nnecessarily by experience. This is crucial \nbecause situations and circumstances will want \nus to make a detour and leave our learning and \nlife to chance. We must therefore be disciplined \nto remain with our resolve to make a clean \nbreak with experience as our best teacher. \nDiscipline in this regard means learning \nsomething new every day by wisdom rather \nthan experience. It means consciously getting \nbetter by the day in you chosen field. Discipline \nwill demand taking advantage of every learning \nopportunity that comes our way. It will mean \nwe must pay the price for learning by wisdom \u2013 \ninvest in books, magazines, seminars and other \nmeans by which we may become wiser. \nIt is much easier and cheaper to learn \nconsciously by wisdom than to learn by",
