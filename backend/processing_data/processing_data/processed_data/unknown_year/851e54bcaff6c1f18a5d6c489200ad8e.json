A great deal \nof scholarship has been devoted to analysing \nhow and in what situations different \napproaches can be applied most effectively. \n \nConflict management approaches can be \nclassified into two broad categories. Firstly, on \nthe basis of the level of escalation which the \nparticular conflict is being managed. In this \nsense, one can distinguish between the \npeaceful and the 'military' approaches. The \ntrademarks of the peaceful approach are \nnegotiation, verbal persuasion, use of \ninducements, denial of privileges, and subtle \nmanipulation short of the use of physical \nforces, while those of the military approach \nrelate to the use of physical coercion. The use \nof physical force could be by a party to a \nconflict or third party, to promote one side's \ninterest, impose a settlement, or create a \nsituation in which diplomatic negotiations can \noccur. \n \nSecondly, conflict management approaches \ncan also be classified according to the status of \nthe participants in the bargaining process. For \nexample, a conflict could be managed through \n'negotiation', that is, direct bargaining by the \nparties involved in the conflict; or through \n'mediation', that is with the help of a third part \n \n1.
