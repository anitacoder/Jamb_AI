In order \nto further examine candidates before being admitted, in\nstitu\ntions now introduced \nscreen\ning tests for candidates \nand this\n \nis now known as post U.T.M.E\n.\n \nThe \nforegoing is \nfurther \nbuttressed\n \nby the point that a correlation had not been made between higher \nJAMB scores and better performance of students during their 100 \nlevel, whereas a \ncorrelation was established between higher \nSenior Secondary Certificate Examination \n(SSC\nE) scores and students performance in higher schools (Lawal, 2016). The minimum \ncut off marks for admissions into Univ\nersities, Polytechn\nics Colleges o\nf Education range\n \nbetween 100\n \n-\n160 (Bamigbola, 2019). The implication of the foregoing is that any \ncandidate who secured admission into any higher institution in Nigeria with 100 marks \nor 25% of the total marks obtainable or 160 marks or 40% had actually p\nerformed below \naverage (Rotimi, 2015)\n.\n \nMost \ninstitutions\n,\n \nwhether public or private\n,\n \nnow admit students \nwho had performed dismally in entrance examinations.\n \n \nStatement of the Problem\ns\n \nMultiple admissions had deprived many Nigerian youths admission into higher \ninstitutions and the North was mostly affected. In order to solve this problem the Federal \nGovernment of Nigeria established JAMB to conduct matriculation examinations into \ntertiar\ny \ninstitutions\n \nin\n \nNigeria.\n \n \nPurpose of the Study\n \nJAMB had been the sole body conducting entrance examinations into higher institutions \nin Nigeria since 1978. \nHowever, there are constraints o\nn the performance of this task as \nthere are many higher institutio\nns in Nigeria and given the sheer size of the nation\u2019s \npopulation of admission \nseekers every year. Coupled with the foregoing is the fact that \nstandards are being lowered yearly as a progre\nssive reduction in cut\n-\noff mark\ns was \nobserved\n. This paper, therefor\ne, evaluates the history and efficiency of JAMB in \nconducting matriculation examinations into higher institutions in Nigeria.\n \n \nHypothesis \n \nHo1:\n \nThere is no significant difference between efficiency of JAMB and admission of \ncandidates with low grades.\n \n \nHo2: T\nhere is no significant difference between\n \nthe\n \nefficiency of JAMB and post U.T.M.E.",
