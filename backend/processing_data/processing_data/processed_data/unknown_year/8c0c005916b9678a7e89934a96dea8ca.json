  "content": "D. frustration \n \nPASSAGE II \nStress is by far the most common cause \nof ill health in our society, and may be the \nunderlying cause of as many as 70-80% of all \nvisits to family doctors. It is also the problem \nthat every doctor shares with patients. Experts \nnote that stress is an issue everyone can relate \nto experimentally. In studying and better \nunderstanding about stress, we can derive \nperso6nal as well as professional benefits. \nStress can be overcome without \nundergoing duress. They often say anyone who \nwants to help someone deal with his/her stress \nshould learn to handle his/hers first. The \nmanifestations of stress are legion. It can \ncontribute or mimick just about any symptom \nyou can think of. However, the main symptoms \nare physical, mental, emotional and \nbehavioural. The causes of stress are multiple \nand varied but they can be classified into \nexternal and internal. External stressors can \ninclude relatively getting sick or dying, jobs \nbeing lost or people criticising or one becoming \nangry. However, most of the stress people \nexperience is self-generated. \nExperts tell us that we create the \nmajority of our upset indicating that because \nwe cause most of our own stress, we can do \nsomething about it. This gives us a measure of \nchoice and control that we do not always have \nwhen outside forces acts on us. This also leads \nto a basic premise about stress reduction. To \nmaster stress-change, you have to figure out \nwhat you are doing that is contributing to your \nproblem and change it. These changes fall into \nbehaviour, thinking, lifestyle choices and / or \nsituations you are in. By getting to the root \ncause of your stress, you can prevent \nrecurrences. \nAs a way of draining off stress energy, \nnothing beats aerobic exercise. To understand \nwhy, we need to review what stress is. People \noften think of stress as pressure at work, a \ndemanding boss, a sick child or rush-hour \ntraffic. These may be triggers but stress is \nactually the body reaction to factors such as \nthese. Stress is the fight-or-flight response in \nthe body, mediated be adrenaline and other \nstress hormones, and comprised such \nphysiologic changes as increased in heart rate \nand blood pressure, faster breathing, muscle \ntension, dilated pupils, dry mouth and \nincreased blood sugar. In order word, stress is \nthe state of increased arousal necessary for an \norganism to defend itself at a time of danger. \nExercise is the most logical way to \ndissipate the excess energy. It is what our \nbodies are trying to do when we pace around \nor tap our legs and fingers. It is much better to \nchannel it into a more complete form of \nexercise like a brisk walk, a run, a bike ride, or \na game of squash. \nJust as we are all capable of mounting \nup and sustaining a stress reaction, we have \nalso inherited the ability to put our bodies into \na state of deep relaxation called the \u2018relaxation \nresponse\u2019. In this state, all the physiologic \nevents in the stress reaction are reversed. \nPulse slows, blood pressure falls, breathing \nslows and muscle relax. \nAdopted from VANGUARD, 19TH March, \n2008 \n6. The expression, \u2026 stress is an issue \neverybody can relate to experimentally, means \nthat \nA. it is better understood when experienced \nB. its problem can be solved by everybody \nC. everybody avoids it \nD. everybody encounters it. \n \n7. Which of the following is true according to \nthe passage? \nA. Stress is mostly caused by internal factors \nB. Stress can only be avoided during relaxation \nC. Stress is better handled by the individual \nD. The issues of stress can be solved with no \neffort \n \n8. According to the passage, the major step in \ncontrolling stress is \nA. changing one\u2019s attitude to stressors \nB. understanding the history of disease \nC. visiting family doctors for check-up and \ntreatment \nD. constant exercise to dissipate every energy \n \n9. The experts feel one can control one\u2019s stress \nbecause \nA. its causes are understandable \nB. it is not difficult to control \nC. external factors contribute less stress \nD. it is individually initiated \n \n10. From the passage, it can be deduced that \nstress is",
