The issue has little to do \nwith being literate or not. It is true that most members \nof NAM (New Awareness Movement) are literate, but \nthis does not make all of us enlightened. We must be \nable to draw a line between the two. You may be literate \nand yet possess a consciousness that is decadent and \nservile. On the other hand, you may not have received \nany formal education and yet may be the greatest \nexponent of progressive ideas. \nHASANA: I agree with what our sister has said. Let us not allow \nourselves to be divided by a greedy and an inflated \nnotion of the of the certificates we possess. In this \ncentury, as we march towards the year 2000, our primary \nconcern should be how best to improve the lot of \nwomanhood in our society. Let us not forget that for \neach woman who is beaten up by her man for flimsy \nreasons, the status of all of us here is downgraded. For \neach woman who is insulted for no other reason than \nthat of her sex, every one of us here is spat on in the \nface. For each woman who is denied \nopportunities in the society simply because she is a \nwoman, the whole lot of us here are dehumanized. Each \nwidow in this society is an Everywoman, and the lot of \nus should be viewed as collective. Each decayed tomato \nthat is cast at her is a collective curse on our fecundity: \neach pebble thrown at her, a missile against our very \nwomanhood. This is an age of awareness, and it is the \nduty of NAM to collectively rise in defence of the rights \nof women. \nIME: We can no longer allow ourselves to be fried alive. We \nare going to squeeze ourselves into tight-fitting \ntrousers,register into judo classes, and then file out \ninto the street and punch the face of every man we \nbehold. \n6. In distinguishing between literacy and enlightenment, \nAduke implies that \nA. it is useless to be literate \nB. enlightenment is inborn \nC. progress can take place without literacy \nD. both literacy and enlightenment are symbiotic. \n7. Hassana believes that NAM should not be divided by \nA. theworthless certificates which the women possess \nB. inflation and greed \nC. a misunderstanding oftheworth of their certificates \nD. a selfish and over-raced beliefin their certificates. \n8. \u2018Each widowin this societyis an Everywoman\u2019 meansthat \nA. every woman in the society is potentially a widow \nB. every widow in the society is a woman \nC.  he suffering of every widow represents the \nburden of all women \nD. widowhood implies the isolation of the \nwoman in society. \n9. The speech of Hassana implies that \nA. it is the practice to throw rotten eggs at women \nB. it is the practice to cast decayed tomatoes at \nwomen \nC. to throw rotten eggs and decayed tomatoes \nat women is to reduce their fecundity \nD. to throw rotten eggs and decayed tomatoes \nat women is dehumanizing. \n10. From the speech by Ime, it is clear that the women \nA. intend to do a real battle with the menfolk \nin defence of their rights \nB. will no longer perform their traditional duties \nC. are henceforth prepared to adopt a policy of \nconfrontation with the men \nD. can do anything that a man can do sometimes \neven better \nPASSAGE III \nWhen I set out for London, little did I suspect that I \nwas not on journey to God\u2019s own city where harmony reigned \nsupreme. So used to the frenzied life of Lagos was I that I had \ncome to associate that city with everything that was chaotic, \nand there was no doubt in my mind that Lagos was one giant \nsymbol of our backwardness. As the plane taxied its way out \nof the tarmac of our national airport, I heaved a sigh of relief, not \nso much  because I was leaving my own country as that I was \nbeing relieved of the tension that had possessed me during \nthose tense hours in the untidy lounge. I had felt so uneasy, \nmy thoughts racing from one uncertainty to another. But I was \nat last air -borne, moving away from the whole uncertainty, \nfrom the whole load of fear, towards a place which I supposed \nwould be an El Dorado. \nEverything that happened in the plane passed through \nmy eyes like pictures on the screen. The white air hostess who \ninstructed me on how to use the safety belt was an angel, what \nwith her beauty, her pretty blue dress, and her ever -smiling \nface. The same lady of the air served me snacks and supper. \nAnother angel, whose queenly voice through an invisible \npublic address system, dished out occasional information on \nthe progress of our journey. I had never felt so relaxed, and my \njolted heartbeats each time the plane took what appeared like a \nsudden brief descent, did not matter. When eventually we were \nset for landing, the  anxiety that came over me was almost \nthrilling. What was the wonderland going to be like? So \noverwhelmed was I that I almost lost consciousness of what \nhappened thereafter. \nBut I would never forget the shock that greeted me \nwhen we arrived in the tube station and boarded a train to behold \nthe sea of white faces and the furtive glances from apparently \nindifferent co -passengers. I believe that the nolstagic feeling \nfor Lagos which later became part of my life all my days in \nLondon began at this point. \n11. Before the writer left Lagos, he believed London was \nA. a very neat place B. a very peaceful place \nC.    situated in paradise D. noiseless. \n12. Before the plane left Lagos, the writer must have \nA. had a second thought about leaving his country \nB. been very hungry in the lounge \nC. been frightened of all the people in the lounge \nD. detested the filth surrounding the lounge. \n13. When the plane finally took off the writer felt happy because \nA. he was thrilled to be in a plane \nB. he believed that he was travelling to a problem- \nfree country \nC. he no longer felt uneasy",
