Each question carries 3 marks. \n \nPASSAGE I \nWhen man evolved a conscience, his basic relationship \nwith the other animals began to change. Until then, they were \nbroadly divided into those which ate him when they got the \nchance, those which he ate when he got the chance, and a third \ngroup which competed with him for food, or was otherwise a \nnuisance to him in the business of keeping alive. \nIn the primitive situation, man was, therefore, basically \nagainst Nature but, as the battle was progressively won, \nconscience crept in; the awareness of responsibility, and a failure \nto meet it, produced feelings of guilt. Those who live in cities \nand need no longer do battle against Nature are nowadays most \nactively for Nature. \n \n  Use of English 2003  \n \n \nAt this time, something like a thousand kinds of animals \n(vertebrate animals) can be said to be in danger of extinction. A \nfew of them have been reduced to this precarious position by \nextensive killing but the majority are disappearing only as fast \nas the particular kind of country they need for existence is itself \ndisappearing: and all this at the hands of man, as often as not by \nmistake. \nThere are three species of turtles whose future survival \nis menaced by the demand for turtle soup, which would hardly \njustify the extermination of a giant reptile whose family has existed \nfor 200 million years. Leopards are in jeopardy because of the \nfashion for their skins. As they get rarer, the prices rise and, as \nleopard skin coats become more expensive, the demand increases. \nNo species can long survive the price of N60,000 which a half- \ngrown baby leopard now carries on its skin. And crocodiles, the \nlongest surviving reptiles, are now dwindling alarmingly as a \nresult of the fashion in crocodile skin for ladies\u2019 handbags and \nmen\u2019s shoes. \nThe human population explosion spreads mankind \nacross the land surfaces of the earth at an alarming rate. There \nwill be twice as many of us before most of us are dead. Does this \nmean no room for wild animals? Of course not. With ingenuity \nand forethought, a place can be kept for them. To destroy their \nhabitat is as unnecessary as it would be to pull down a great \ncathedral in order to grow potatoes on the site. A campaign to \nsave what remains is the concern of a new kind of Noah\u2019s Ark \u2013 \nthe World Wildlife Fund. It does not believe that all is lost. \nAdapted from Peter Scott\u2019s article in Sunday Times \n \n1. The basic causes of the elimination of certain animals \nfrom the earth include \nA. man\u2019s decision to live in cities and the \ndevelopment of large farmlands \nB. extensivekilling of animals and the fast \ndisappearance of their favourable habitats \nC. man\u2019s penchant for meat and the sale of \nanimals for meat and hides \nD. a deliberate battle against Nature and the quest \nfor leopard skin. \n \n2. From the passage, the attitude of the writer can be \ndescribed as.",
