The \nmeaning of the foregoing is that only the Federal Government of Nigeria could establish \nand own universities. University admission and by extension, education became the \nexclusive res\nponsibility of the federal government alone. Secondly in addition to the \nexisting six universities\n,\n \nthe federal government established seven more making the \nnumber to be thirteen before 1978. Finally, the federal government set up a committee \nknown as\n \nthe\n \nCommittee on University Entrance (CUE) headed by M.S. Angulu to advice \ngovernment\n,\n \ninter\n-\nalia\n, on how to solve issues generated by university admission in \nNigeria (Anyawu, 2016). It was this committee that recommended among other things \nthe establishment o\nf the \nUniversities Central Admission \nBoard whi\nch \nmetamorphiz\ned\n \ninto JAMB in 1978 (Anyawu, 2016).\n \n \nHaving established \nthe foregoing point\n,\n \nit is quite pertinent to examine the formative \nyears of JAMB\u2019s existence with a view to understanding how it has fared \nin carrying out \nthe mandate given to it. JAMB (2019\na\n) noted that JAMB \nwas established by Decree No. 2 \nof 1978 as amended by Decree No 33 o\nf 1989. The\ns\ne\n \ndecrees em\npowered JAMB, \ninter\n-\nalia\n,\n \nto conduct matriculation examinations into all \nUniversities\n, \nPolytechnics \nand \nColleges \nof \nEducation in Nigeria\n.\n \nIn \norder to achieve the foregoing mandate JAMB was further \nempowered to appoint all personnel like examiners, invigilators,\n \nmoderators and other \npersonnel\n \nit considered necessary in the conduct of its exam\ninations. Moreover, JAMB \nwas also enabled by these decrees to admit candidates who have been adjudged to have \nsatisfied all requirements for admission into tertiary institutions in Nigeria (JAMB, \n2019\na\n). JAMB Act (2019\nb\n) submitted that the enabling decrees\n \nestablishing JAMB also \ndefined\n, among other things,\n \nmembership of the Board\n,\n \ntenure of office of Board \nmembers\n,\n \nremoval from office of \nBoard \nmembers\n,\n \nministerial power over the \nBoard, \nother \nstaff of the \nBoard, \nfund of the \nBoard,\n \nexpenditure of t\nhe Board\n.\n \n \nUkoba (2017) opined that JAMB prior to 2014, was conducting two different examinations \ninto higher institutions in Nigeria. One was the University Matriculation Examination \n(UME) and the other was the Monotechnics, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education \nEx\naminations (MPCE). It \nwas,\n \nhowever\n,\n \nin 2010 that JAMB harmonized the two \nexaminations \nand so the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) was born. \nThis was apparently done to save cost and\n \ntime and at the same time, it gav\ne equal \nopportunities fo\nr all candidates seeking admission into tertiar\ny institutions in Nigeria.",
