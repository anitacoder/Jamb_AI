The duration of each \nexaminatio\nn was \ntwo hours forty\n-\nfive minutes with a grade range of 0\n-\n400 and a validity \nperiod of one year. It must also \nbe observed that JAMB conducted its examinations only \nonce a year. \n \n \nJAMB (2019\nc\n) observed that the introduction of biometric data capture for sta\nff of the \nBoard and can\ndidates seeking admission \nwent a long way to check examination \nmalpractices and also to monitor the movement of staff. Coupled with the foregoing, the \nBoard also went digital with supply of computers to staff\n.\n \nAll\n \nthese culminated in \ntimely \nrelease of examinations\u2019 results within two weeks \ninstead of within two or three months \nas was the practice. Lawal (2019) opined \nthat\n \nJAMB had been un\n-\nrelenting in checking \nexamination malpractices in all its centres nationwide.\n \nThere are laid down rules and \nprocedures to be met by these centres and any contravention attracted stiff penalties\n; as \nit was the case in 2019, w\nhen JAMB banned\n \non\ne hundred of its centres\n \nnationwide\n \nfor \ncommitting various examination offences. JAMB (2019\nd\n) noted that one of the many ways \nby which the \nBoard \nhad been assisting candidates to ease their yearly burden of obtaining \nadmi\nssion into higher institutions of their choice was the provision of an online support \nsystem known as the \nCentral Online Suppor\nt System \n(COSS)\n.\n \nThis\n \nincluded \nCandidate\n/General \nSupport \nTicket, \nDevelopment Partners \nand \nCentre Support \nand \nLocal \nSupport\n.\n \n \nTo buttress the point that paucity of funds was not one of the many\n \nchallenges bedeviling \nJAMB, \naccording to (Nwafor, 20\n17) \nwhereas\n \nbetween 2010 and 2016, the total amount of \nmoney remitted to the \nfederal government \nby JAMB was 5 million \nNaira\n,\n \nit rose to 7.8 \nbillion \nNaira \nin 2017 alone. That JAMB had, not only adopted technology but had \nentrenched \nit\n \nis no longer in doubt. I\nredia (201\n9) had noted that th\ne JAMB Registra\nr\n, \nthrough the use of technology, could kno\nw\n \nwhen a candidate registers, the exact time of \nregistration\n,\n \nthe system used to register the\n \ncandidate as\n \nwell as the exact location \nof the \nregistration centre. Ired\nia (2019) ad\nded that \nbiometric \nveri\nfication of candidates was a \nmaj\nor \nachievement\n \nof the Board which had gone a long \nway in checking impersonation \nat\n \nexamination centres.\n \n \nIn spite of these daunting achievements by JAMB, the task of conducting examinations \ninto all the tertiary institutions in Nigeria with the teeming population of her \nyouths\n \nis \nrather \nHerculean \n(Rotimi, 2015). The introduction of U.T.M.E\n.\n \nhad made a mockery\n \nof the \nfact that admission requirements into Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of \nEdu\ncation are different.
