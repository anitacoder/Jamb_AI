The years following the civil war brought new developments into the \neducational \nlandscape of Nigeria. The Gowon reg\nime wanted to use education \nas a tool for national \nre\n-\nbirth and reconciliation. The point must be r\neiterated were that during the civil war, \neducational activities, in most cases were disrupted or actually paralyzed \nparticularly\n \nin \nEastern Nig\neria. The population of the country was \nrapidly\n \nincreasing especially in \npost\n-\ncivil \nwar Nigeria and the teeming \npopulation of Nigerian youths were becoming \nincreasingly ambitious and were vig\norously pursuing university educa\ntion especially in \nthe South.\n \nCoupled with the foregoing is also the fact\n \nthat the nation needed s\nkilled \nmanpower to harness and articulate the \nrehabilitation programmes of \nthe Federal \nGovernment and so u\nniversity education became highly sought after.\n \n \nThis period, however, co\ni\nncided\n \nwith a time when the existing u\nniver\nsities could no \nlonger satisfy the yearnings of youths seeking admission. This w\nas occasioned by lack of \nfacilities like classrooms, hostels, laboratories and personnel which concomitantly \nconstrained the universities to limit the numbers of students admitted annually. Anyawu \n(2016) submitted that this period of low admission also saw\n \na period of imbalance in \nadmission where the North continued to protest against the number of intakes \nvis\n-\n\u00e0\n-\nvis\n \nthe \nSouth\n. Since each university was conducting \nits\n \nadmission on its own, another \nproblem of multiple admission consequently arose. This was a \nsituation when\n;\n \nbecause \napplicants were not sure if they would be offered admission by a particular university, \napplicants would now apply to \ndifferent\n \nu\nniversities and would be offered admission by \nmore than one. In such a situation, candidates so offered\n \nadmission by different \nuniversities \nwould not reject such multiple admissions on time thereby preventing other \ncandidates from being admitted (Anyawu, 2\n016). Since the South embraced w\nestern \neducation earlier than the North, cases of multiple admissions, \nunderstandably, were \nmore rampant in the South than the North. It was then argued by the North that the South \nwas deliberately using multiple admissions to deprive its youths\n \nfrom being admitted \ninto \nuniversities\n. Th\nus this era of \ncut throat c\nompetition and mutual suspicion between \nthe North and \nSouth that\n \ncharacterized pre\n-\ncivil war \nNigeria,\n \nwas being re\n-\nawakened. \nAnyawu (2016) opined that all these culminated in increasing \ndemands for the",
