The centre was \nintended to serve the whole of the defunct \nNorthern Region, and there were several \nreasons for choosing Abuja. The first was the \nexcellence of the traditional pottery made in \nthe Emirate. Secondly, fire-wood is plentiful; \nthis is a most important consideration, because \nin the making of glazed pottery, more firewood \nthan clay is required. Thirdly, there are good \nclays, and good local sources for the raw \nmaterials needed for the glazes. Fourthly, \nwater, which is an-other important raw \nmaterial, is plentiful. Finally, Abuja is in a \ncentral position for the whole region and is a \ntown where learners from many different parts \ncan find a congenial temporary home, and \nwhere the Emir and his Council are actively \ninterested in the project. \nNearly all the making is done by a \nprocess called \u2018throwing\u2019, so called because the \nlumps of clay are thrown by the potter onto a \nwheel-head. They are weighed out so that each \npot will be roughly the same size; for example, \nfor making pint-sized jugs, the lumps of clay \nwill be one and a half kilogrammes. The potter \nsits on the saddle of the wheel and spins it by \npushing a pedal with his left foot. He has a \nbowl of water, a loofah, a bamboo knife, a \npointed stick or porcupine quill, a wooden- \nsmoothing tool which potters call a rib, and a \npiece of wire-like object that is used for \nwedging. He makes the wheel-head slightly \ndamp, and throws the lumps into the middle. \nThe first work is to force the lump to the \ncentre, then he presses his thumb into the \nmiddle of the lump, using water to keep it \nslippery. When the bottom is of the right \nthickness, he begins to draw up the walls until \nthey are of the right height. Then he shapes \nthe belly and shoulder of the pot. He trims off \nany waste clay. In this way, a small and \nmedium-sized pot can be made more quickly \nand accurately. \n1. Which question Paper Type of Uses of \nEnglish is given to you? \nA. Type D \nB. Type I \nC. Type B \nD. Type U \n \n2. Which of the following is true according to \nthe passage? \nA. Anyone, with almost no training, can run \npots on a wheel. \nB. Pots can be made quickly and correctly. \nC. A pot thrown on a wheel is less likely to \nbreak. \nD. The potter does not have to work hard if he \nuses the wheel. \n3. From the passage, how does a potter make \nseveral pots of almost identical size? \nA. By having the knowledge of different pots. \nB. By weighing the lumps of clay. \nC. By having the right tools \nD. By knowing what to do from experience. \n \n4. The phrase trims off any waste clay, as used \nin the passage, means to--- \nA. cut away unnecessary parts \nB. force the clay to the centre \nC. divide the clay into two \nD. wash away different colours. \n \n5. The word congenial, as used in the passage, \nmeans--- \nA. congested \nB. precise \nC. similar \nD. nice \n \nPASSAGE II \nMusic plays a vital role in human society. \nGood music provides entertainment and \nemotional release, and it accompanies activities \nranging from dances to religious ceremonies. \nMusic is heard everywhere; in auditoriums, \nhomes, elevators, schools, sports arenas and \non the streets. Recorded performance is a \nsensational innovation elevation of the \ntwentieth century. Thanks to modern \ntechnology like compact disc (CD) digital video \ndisc (DVD) and the MP 3 player, music can now \nbe heard in diverse places. Such places include \nliving rooms and cars, jogging paths can also",
