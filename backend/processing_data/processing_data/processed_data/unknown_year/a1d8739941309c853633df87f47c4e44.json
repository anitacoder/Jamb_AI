If you own a car, you realize \nthat you must put oil and gas into it, and you \nmust put water in the radiator and take care of \nthe care as a whole. You begin to develop quite \na little thermodynamic sense. You know that \nyou are either going to have to keep the \nmachine in a good order or it is going to be in \ntrouble and fail to function. We have not been \nseeing our Spaceship Earth as an integrally- \ndesigned machine which to be persistently \nsuccessful, must be comprehended and \nserviced in total. \nNow there is one outstanding important \nfact regarding Spaceship Earth, and this is that \nno instruction book came with it. I think it is \nvery significant that there is no instruction \nbook, for successfully operating of our ship, in \nview of the infinite attention to all other details \ndisplayed by our ship. It must be taken as \ndeliberate and purposeful that an instruction \nbook was omitted. Lack of instruction has \nforces us to find out that there are two kinds of \nmangoes \u2013 unripe mangoes that will kill us and \nripped mangoes which will nourish us. And we \nhad to find out ways of telling which-was-which \nmangoes before we ate it or otherwise we \nwould die. So we were forced, because of this \nto devise scientific experimental procedures \nand to interpret effectively the significance of \nthe experimental findings. Thus, because the \ninstruction manual was missing, we are \nlearning how we can safely survive on the \nplanet. \nQuite clearly, all living being are utterly \nhelpless at the moment of birth. The human \nchild stays helpless longer that the young of \nany species. Apparently, it is part of \u2018invention\u2019 \nthat man is meant to be utterly helpless \nthrough certain anthropological phases. When \nhe begins to be able to get on a little better, he \nis meant to discover some of the physical \nprinciples inherent in the universe as well as \nthe many recourses around him which will \nfurther multiply his knowledge. Designed into \nthis Spaceship Earth\u2019s total wealth was a big \nsafety factor. This allowed man to be very \nignorant for a long time until he had amassed \nenough experiences from which to extract \nprogressively the system of generalized \nprinciples governing increase of energy. The \ndesign omission of the instruction book forced \nman to discover retrospectively just what his \nmost important capabilities are. He learned to \ngeneralize fundamental principles of universe. \n \nAdapted from Oluikpe, B.O. et al (2005) \nIntensive English for Senior Secondary \nSchool 2, Onitsha: AFP \n \n1. Which Use of English Paper Type is given to \nyou? \nA. Type A \nB. Type B \nC. Type C \nD. Type D \n \n2. According to the writer, the exciting thing \nabout Spaceship Earth is that \nA. has no instruction manual \nB. it is not difficult to maintain \nC. is peculiar to other automobiles \nD. is relatively easy to operate \n \n3. The absence of instruction manual in \nSpaceship Earth has \nA. made the operation of the Spaceship Earth \ndifficult \nB. forced man to devise other means of \ntravelling in spacecraft \nC. challenged man\u2019s inquisitiveness \nD. made man helpless \n \n4. From the passage, it can be deduced that \nman \nA. learns by experiment and education \nB. learns by chance and accidentally \nC. is incapable of solving all his problems \nD. by his nature is in constant search of \nknowledge \n \n5. The writer\u2019s mood in the passage is that of \nA. non-committal \nB. pessimism \nC. optimism",
