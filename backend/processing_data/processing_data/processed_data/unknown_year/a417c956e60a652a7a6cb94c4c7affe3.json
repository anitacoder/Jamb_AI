Instead of the student being in control \nof the language, the language seems now to be in control of the \nstudent.  \nAll of this can be very depressing and the student can \nstart to feel very anxious. Working in a foreign language is also \nvery tiring, and the concentration and self-discipline required to \ncorrect one\u2019s mistakes is very great indeed. \n \n11.

The almost manic pleasure with which children \nwatch the collapse in a second of the product of long play- \nlabour has puzzled many, especially since the child does not \nappreciate it at all if his tower falls by accident or by a helpful \nuncle\u2019s hand. He, the builder, must de stroy it himself. This \ngame, I should think, arises from the not so distant experience of \nsudden falls at the very time when standing upright on wobbly \nlegs afforded a new and fascinating perspective on existence. \nThe child who consequently learns to make a tower \u2018stands up\u2019 \nenjoys causing the same tower to waver and collapse. In addition \nto the active mastery over a previously passive event, it makes \none feel stronger to know that there is somebody weaker \u2013 and \ntowers, unlike little sisters, can\u2019t cry and call, \u2018Mummy!\u2019. \n \n16. In the passage, \u2018manic pleasure\u2019 means \nA. wicked pleasure B. children pleasure \nC.  unlimited pleasure D. human pleasure. \n \n17. The expression \u2018must kick it and make it collapse\u2019 in this \ncontext means \nA. is forced to kick it and demolish it. \nB. is obliged to kick it and make it collapse \nC. cannot resist the urge to demolish it \nD. ought to kick it and make it collapse \n \n18. According to this passage, it gives the child great pleasure \nA. for Daddy to see the tower he has built \nB. to destroy the tower himself \nC. to se his tower accidentally destroyed \nD. to be helped to destroy the tower. \n \n19. Howdoes the author tryto explain this \u2018destructive stage\u2019? \nA. It is the last stage in child development. \nB. The child wants to displease his parents. \nC. It grows out of the child\u2019s recent experiences \nof sudden falls. \nD. The child is just going through a destructive stage. \n \n20. What other feeling does the child derive from the fall of \nhis tower apart from pleasure? \nA. Strength B. Anxiety C. Pity D. Depression. \n \nPASSAGE V \nThe market was old, timeless Africa, loud, crowded and \nfree. Here, a man sat making sandals from old discarded motor- \ncar tyres, there another worked at an old sewing machine, making \na nightgown-like affair while the buyer waited, a little further on, \nan old goldsmith worked at his dying art, but using, now, copper \nfillings instead of gold to fashion the lovely trinkets women \nwear the world over; elsewhere a woman sold country cloth \nfashioned with such fine art that only Africans think of it as a \ngarment of utility. Trade was slow and loud everywhere. This \nwas as much as social as a shopping centre. For an excuse to \nspend the day at the market, a woman would walk all the way \nfrom her village to town with half a dozen eggs. She would \nspread them on a little bit of ground for which she paid rent. \nThrough the day she would squat on the ground and talk to \nothers who came for the same reason. She would refuse to sell \nher wares till it was time to leave. They were the excuse for her \nbeing there. There were many like that. But there were many \nothers for whom trade was an earnest business. Whether is \nearnest or as an excuse, the traders were boisterously free, loud- \nmouthed and happy. The laugher of the market was a laughter \nfound nowhere else in all the world\u2026 \n \n21. According to the passage, the woman with half a dozen \neggs in the market \nA. is doing earnest business",
