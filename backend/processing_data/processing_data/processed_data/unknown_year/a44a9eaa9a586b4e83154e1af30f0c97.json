Traditionally, records of \nevents were kept only in people\u2019s minds. It depended very \nmuch on the retentive power of the human memory. This was \nextremely dangerous as people either forgot events wholly or in \npart, or deliberately falsified details to suit their various interests. \nInterminable arguments were thus the order of the day. Even \nwriting which replaced mental recording was not entirely free \nfrom these shortcomings as untruths could be written as true \nrecords either willingly or inadvertently. With the advent of the \nelectronic memory, however, these dangers have been largely \novercome. Recordings on audio and video cassettes now show \nnot only what happened, but also who did or said what including \nhow and when. \n21.
