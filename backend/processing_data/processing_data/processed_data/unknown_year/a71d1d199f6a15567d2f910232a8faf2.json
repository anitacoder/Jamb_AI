The experiment is used to demonstrate that \nA. transpiration occurs through the leaves B. plants \nlose water through guttation C. leaves are \nimportant to photosynthesis D. water is necessary \nfor photosynthesis \n \n13. In the experiment, the layer of oil serves to prevent \nwater loss by \nA. Osmosis B. Transpiration C. Evaporation \nD. Guttation \n \n14. If water that has been coloured red is poured at the \nbase of a wilting plant, it will appear as a red stain in the \ncells of the \nA. phloem B. parenchyma C. xylem D. epidermis \n \n15. The stunted growth of a leguminous plant suffering \nfrom nitrogen deficiency may be corrected by \ninoculating the soil with \nA. saprophytic bacteria B. rhizobium \nC. denitrifying bacteria D. nitrosomonas \n16.
