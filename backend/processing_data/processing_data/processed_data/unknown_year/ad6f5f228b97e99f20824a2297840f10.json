The reason: its power supply was a \n\u2018battery\u2019 made of bacteria. For the first time, \npractical amounts of electricity were being \nproduced by a form of life and put to use. \n \nBio cell, the new power supply had a liquid \nfuel containing tiny forms of life that changed \nthe fuel directly into electric energy; this was \nfar more than an interesting experiment. The \nbio cell is being develop as producers of \nelectricity for radio, for signal to guide ship, for \nlighting and other uses. Though the working \nbio cell is only a few years old, some scientist \nfeels that it will one day produce power cheaply \nas is now being done by other method, and \nthat the bio cell will use materials that would \notherwise be consider a waste. Early bio cells \nwere powered with sugar, but a wide range of \nfuel can be used. Work is being done using sea \nwater to feed the bacteria. \n \nElectricity from living cells is no new idea. \nMan experience the strange shock produce by \nsome fish even before electricity was really \ndiscovered. Then in time, there were other \ndiscoveries. Benjamin Franklin found that \nlightening in the sky was electricity. Luigi \nGalvani found some electricity in the muscles \nand nerves of animals, but the African catfish \nproduce far more electricity than most other \nliving creatures. And other fish, the electric eel, \nwell named, for it has an even greater electric \ncharge. Research works also discovered that \neven humans produce small amount of \nelectricity in their bodies. Our heart produces a \nvery small amount that can be measured, so \ndo our brain. The bio cell is completely new in \nthe field of power production and as yet, no \nmass- production models have begun to \nreplace the older type of batteries. Its might be \nwondered, then, what the excitement is all \nabout. \n1. Which question paper type of use of English \nis giving to you? \n(a) Type A \n(b) Type B \n(c) Type C \n(d) Type D \n \n2. The writer\u2019s posture, as conveyed in the \nstatement Electricity from living cells is no new \nidea, can be describe as \n(a) Ineffectual \n(b) Contentious \n(c) Logical \n(d) unguarded \n \n3. Which of the following is true according to \nthe passage? \n(a) Scientist felt that bio-cell would produce \nvery costly energy \n(b) Biocell, at the beginning, derived their \nenergy from sugar \n(C) Sugar and fuel were initially used as source \nof energy for biocells \n(d) Biocells were forms of power used by the \nscientists \n \n4. The inventor of biocell justified the need for \nit by saying that would \n(a) develop ways for changing biocell into fuel \nfor use \n(b) yield a source of energy without much \nspending \n(c) produce electricity for all type of machines \n(d) produce signal to guide all ship and other \nvessels \n \n5. According to the passage, electricity was \nfirst discover in \n(a) heart and brains \n(b) muscles of animals \n(c) lightning \n(d) fish. \n \nPASSAGE II \nLike a clock with the pendulum in full swing, \nthe mind moves as fast as time. But we ought \nto mind our thoughts for if they turn to be our",
