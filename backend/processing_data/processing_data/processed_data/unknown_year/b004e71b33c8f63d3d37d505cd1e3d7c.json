Now, \nthe usual political thing to do when charges are levelled against \nyou is either to ignore them or to deny them without giving \ndetails. But before I answer any of your questions, let me state \ncategorically that I have not touched a kobo of the N50,000 we \ncontributed. Every kobo of it has been used in defraying political \ncampaign expenses. \nAs a matter of fact, during one of my meet -the-press \nconferences, Tony Agiwa accosted me and said, \u2018Honourable \nSenator, what about this fund we hear about?\u2019 I told him there \nwas no secret about the fund and that he s hould meet Abu O. \nAbu to get details of the fund. I told him, \u2018You will find that the \npurpose of the fund was primarily to defray political expenses.\u2019 \nIn answer to another one of his questions, I said that neither \ncontributors to this fund, nor contributors to any of my \ncampaigns had ever received any special consideration that he \nwould not have received as an ordinary constituent. And I can \nsay that never, since I became a Senator, have I made a telephone \ncall for them to an agency or have I gone down to an agency on \ntheir behalf. Records will show that, and these records are in the \nhands of the Administrator. \n \n16.

Abu is portrayed as \nA. a corrupt politician  B.  the administrator of the fund \nC. an ordinarytaxpayer   D. agovernmentofficial  E. a citizen \n \nPASSAGE V \nThe land was ready and ploughed, waiting for the crops. \nAt night, the earth was alive with insects singing and rustling \nabout in search of food. But suddenly, by mid-November, the \nrain fled away: the rain-clouds fled away and left the sky bare. \nThe sun danced dizzily in the sky, with a strange cruelty. Each \nday the land was covered in a haze of mist as the sun sucked up \nthe last drop of moisture out of the earth. The family sat down in \ndespair, waiting and waiting. Their hopes had run so high; the \ngoats had started producing milk, which they had eagerly poured \non their porridge, now they ate plain porridge with no milk. It \nwas impossible to plant corn, maize, pumpkin and water-melon \nseeds in the dry earth. They sat the whole day in the shadow of \nthe huts and even stopped thinking, for the rain had fled away. \nOnly the children were quite happy in their little girl world. They \ncarried on with their game of making house like their mother and \nchattered to each other in light, soft tones. They made children \nfrom sticks around which they tied rags, and scolded them \nseverely in an exact imitation of their own mother. Their voices \ncould be heard scolding all day long: \u2018You stupid thing, when I \nsend you to draw water, why do you spill half of it out of the \nbucket?\u2019 \u2018You stupid thing! Can\u2019t you mind the porr idge pot \nwithout letting the porridge burn?\u2019 Then, they would beat the \nrag-dolls on their bottoms with severe expressions. \nThe adults paid no attention to this; their nerves were \nstretched to breaking point waiting for the rain to fall out of the \nsky. Nothing was important, beyond that. All their animals had \nbeen sold during the bad years to purchase food, and of all their \nherd only two goats were left. It was the women of the family \nwho finally broke down under the strain of waiting for rain. \n(Taken from Bessie Head\u2019s The collector of Treasures) \n \n21.
