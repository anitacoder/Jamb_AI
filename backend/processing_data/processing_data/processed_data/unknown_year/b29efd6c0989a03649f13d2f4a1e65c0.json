Each question carries 3 marks. \n \nPASSAGE I \nIf our thought is to be clear and we are to succeed in \ncommunicating it to other people, we must have some method of \nfixing the meaning of the words we use. When we use a word \nwhose meaning is not certain, we may well be asked to define it. \nThere is a useful traditional device for doing this by indicating \nthe class to which whatever is indicated by the term belongs, \nand also the particular property which distinguishes it from all \nother members of the same class. Thus we may define a whale as \na marine animal that spouts\u2019. \u2018Marine animal\u2019 in this definition \nindicates the general class to which the whale belongs, and \n\u2018spouts\u2019 indicates the particular property that distinguishes \n \n  Use of English 2002  \nwhales from other such marine animals as fishes, seals, jellyfish \nand lobsters. In the same way, we can define an even number as \na finite integer divisible by two, or a democracy as a system of \ngovernment in which the people themselves rule. \nThere are other way s, of course, of indicating the \nmeanings of words. We may, for example, find it hard to make a \nsuitable definition of the word \u2018animal\u2019, so we say that an animal \nis such a thing as a rabbit, dog, fish or goat. Similarly, we may \nsay that religion is such a system as Christianity, Islam, Judaism \nand Buddhism. This way of indicating the meaning of a term by \nenumerating examples of what it includes is obviously of limited \nusefulness. If we indicated our use of the word \u2018animal\u2019 as above, \nour hearers might, for example, be doubtful whether a sea - \nanemone or a slug was to be included in the class of animals. It \nis, however, a useful way of supplementing a definition if the \ndefinition itself is definite without being easily understandable. \nFailure of an attempt at definition to serve its purpose may result \nfrom giving as distinguishing mark one which either does not \nbelong to all the things the definition is intended to include, or \ndoes belong to some members of the same general class which \nthe definition is intended to exclude. \nAdapted from Straight  and  Crooked Thinking,  by R.  H. \nThouless  \n \n1.  The expression we may well be asked as used in the \npassage means \nA. it is quite likely that we will be asked \nB. we cannot escape being asked \nC. the listener is always justified to ask questions \nD. it is inconceivable that we will be asked. \n2. From the passage, which of these is a disadvantage of \ndefining by enumeration. \nA. The words or objects listed may not all share \nsimilar characteristics. \nB. Enumeration always leaves doubts in the mind \nof the speaker. \nC. The property and examples enumerated may \nnot be all-inclusive. \nD. Many important members of the group may \nbe left out of the enumeration. \n \n3. One of these summarizes the approaches to definition \ndiscussed in the passage. \nA. Specifying clearly what distinguishes a \nparticular word or object from its traditional \ngroups. \nB. Indicating the class of a word and mentioning \nits general property with examples. \nC. Giving general and specific features followed \nby  \nexamples of what the object or word includes. \nD. Mentioning the class of a word or object with \nits specific property. \n \n4. The writer uses the expression fixing the meaning of \nthe words we use to mean \nA. getting even with the people who always ask \nfor definitions",
