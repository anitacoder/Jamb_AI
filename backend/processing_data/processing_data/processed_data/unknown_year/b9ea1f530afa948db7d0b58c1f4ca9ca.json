What the foregoing means is \nthat if JAMB is really efficient in carrying out its mandate, there would not have been any \nneed for higher institutions to conduct separate screening of candidates seeking \nadmission as epitomized in the \npost\n \nU.T.M.E\n.\n \nFailure \nof JAMB in addressing lapses in the \nadmission process\nes, therefore,\n \nled to post U.T.M.E.\n \n \nThis is in tandem with the assertion of (Sylvester, 2016) that higher \ninstitutions\n \nin Nigeria \nbegan to conduct post U\n.\nT\n.\nM\n.\nE\n.\n \nwh\nen the conduct of matriculation examina\ntions\n \nby \nJAMB became riddled wi\nth\n \nmalpractices.\n \n \nConclusion and \nRecommendations\n \n \nA historical evaluation of JAMB and its efficiency in\n \nthe\n \neducational\n \ndevelopment of \nNigeria was carried out and the study covered the years between 1978, when the Board \nwas es\ntablished and 2019, the current year. Looking at the events surrounding the \nestablishment of \nJAMB\n, one would readily agree that the Federal \nGovernment\n \nof Nigeria \nthen had \nalmost no option other than to s\net up the Board. There was heat in the body \npolitic \nand the palpable tension generated by multiple admissions pitched the North \nagain\nst the South. This period coincid\ned with the period of North/South dichotomy and \ngovernment wanted the problem solved once and for all hence the establishment of \nJAMB.\n \n \nAdmitte\ndly with the establishment of\n \nJAMB and harmonization of\n \nadmission processes\n,\n \nthe hue and cry generated hitherto \nwere doused albeit temporarily. The \nestablishment\n \nof \nmore universities, especially in Northern Nigeria, also contributed in no small measure \nto \nallay the fears of domination of the North by the \nSouth \neducationally.",
