In the course of a century, so \nmany mass killers have vanished that two-thirds of all deaths \nare now associated with the diseases of old age. Those who die \nyoung are more often than not, the victims of accidents, violence \nand suicide. \nThese changes in public health are generally equated \nwith progress and are attributed to more or better medical care. \nIn fact, there is no evidence of any direct relationship between \nchanging disease patterns and the so -called progress of \nmedicine. \nThe impotence of medical services to change life \nexpectancy and the insignificance of much contemporary clinical \ncare in the curing of diseases are all obvious, well documented \nbut well suppressed. \nNeither the proportion of doctors in a population nor \nthe quality of the clinical tools at their disposal nor the number \nof hospital beds is a causal factor in the striking changes in \n \nand treat such conditions as pernicious anaemia and \nhypertension, or to correct congenital malformations by surgical \ninterventions, increase our understanding of disease but do nor \nreduce its incidence. The fact that there are more doctors where \ncertain diseases have become rare has little to do with ability to \ncontrol or eliminate them. It simply means that doctor, more than \nother professionals, determine where they work. Consequently, \nthey tend to gather where the climate is healthy, where the water \nis clean and where people work and can pay for their services. \n \n1. The statement, \u2018The diseases afflicting Western societies \nhave undergone dramatic changes\u2019 implies that \nA. changes have taken place in the mode of \ndisease affliction \nB. medical services have been important in \nchanging life expectancy \nC. a lot of significant progress has taken place in \npublic health \nD. deaths from diseases in Western societies are \nminimal. \n \n2. The writer is of the view that the diseases which prevail \nin contemporary Western societies \nA. result from modern life styles",
