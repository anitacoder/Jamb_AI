The society \nwas ruled by a king or an emir and his traditional chiefs or by the \ncouncil of elders or clan heads. Where there existed the \nhierarchical system as in the Yoruba and Hausa kingdoms, \nsuccession to the throne was mainly patriarchal. A recorded \nexception was the case of Queen Amina of the Zazzau Empire \nwho ruled in the 15th century A.D a host of unsung and \nunrecorded women regents and at times women village rulers \nabound, especially in the present Ondo State where some \ninfluential traditional female chiefs and regents still exist. In \nIbadan, the famous Efunsetan Aniwura held political as well as \neconomic sway and it took a lot of drive, brain work and political \nengineering for the then king and his council of chiefs to subdue \nher. The history of the various towns and villages of the period \ncould boast of such women who were actively engaged in the \nrunning of government. \nIn the Igbo soceity, a rise to leadership position was \nthrough demonstrated ability in fostering societal survival rather \nthan heritage. Women\u2019s voice in the politics of each clan is \ngiven focus either through the guild of wives, the guild of \ndaughters, or the market women\u2019s guild. Women, through these \norgans, could make their feelings known on any issue affecting \ntheir community as a whole or females in particular. Thus, \nunpopular edicts or \u2018decrees\u2019 could be revoked or revised as a \nresult of mounted pressure from any of these female associations. \nNo decision was usually taken by the men without prior \nconsultation with the leaders of the women\u2019s groups. It must \nhowever be emphasized that the degree of women participation \nin politics was yet much limited when compared to that of men. \n \n11. According to the author, electioneering campaign is \nthe approach \nA. best used in politics \nB. used in pre-colonial politics \nC. for choosing kings or emirs \nD. currently in use \n \n12. From the passage, it is obvious that women participated \nin politics. \nA. on equal basis with men \nB. as leaders of men \nC. to a limited extent \nD. as chiefs and regents \n \n13. \u2018Political engineering\u2019 in the passage means \nA. playing of politics \nB. maneuvering in politics \nC. studying of politics \nD. steering political events. \n \n14. Which of the following is implied in the passage? \nA. women are not politicians \nB. women should be confined to the home \nC. women are capable of political leadership \nD. post-colonial politics should not involve \nwomen \n \n15. A suitable title for the passage is \nA. women in politics \nB. champions of women liberation \nC. great women of yesteryears \nD. electioneering campaigns \n \nPASSAGE IV \n \nUse the passage below to answer questions 16 to 26 .
