  "content": "3. \u2018One suspects that the reason why some of our \nnewspapers still manage to break even \u2026\u2019 Suggests that \nsome Nigerian newspapers \nA. would be running at a loss but for obituaries \nB. are patronized only because they specialize in \nobituaries \nC. derive all their revenue from obituaries \nD. invest huge revenue in obituaries. \n4. Obituaries are very popular in Nigeria because \nA. evil things are not said against the dead \nB. every dead Nigerian must have lived a saintly life \nC. only very few Nigerians die natural deaths \nD. Nigerians value their dead greatly. \nPASSAGE II \n\u2018You all know how friendly we are with Okperi. Do you \nthink that any Umuaro man who goes to prison there will come \nback alive? But that apart, do you forget that this is the moon of \nplanting? Do you want to grow this year\u2019s crops in the prison \nhouse in a land where your fathers owe a cow? I speak as your \nelder brother. I have travelled in Olu and I have travelled in Igbo, \nand I can tell you that there is no escape from the white man. He \nhas come. When suffering knocks at your door and you say \nthere is no seat left for him, he tells you not to worry because he \nhas brought his own stool. The white man is like that. Before \nany of you\u2019re here was old enough to tie a cloth between the \nlegs I saw with my own eyes what the white man did to Abame. \nThen I knew there was no escape. As day light chases away \ndarkness so will the white man drive away all our customs. I \nknow that as I say it now it passes by your ears, but it will \nhappen. The white man has power which comes from the true \nGod and it burns like fire. This is the God about whom we preach \nevery eighth day. \u2026. \nUnachukwu\u2019s opponents were now shouting that this \nwas a meeting of an age group, that they had not assembled to \njoin with him in chewing the seed of foolishness which they \ncalled their new religion. \n\u2018We are talking about the white man\u2019s road, \u2018said a voice \nabove the others. \n\u2018Yes, we are talking about the white man\u2019s road. But \nwhen the roof and the walls of a house fall in, the ceiling is not \nleft standing. The white man, the new religion, the soldiers, the \nnew road \u2013 they are all part of the same thing. The white man \nhas a gun, a matchet, a bow and carries fire in his mouth. He \ndoes not fight with one weapon alone\u2019. \n(Taken form Chinua Achebe\u2019s Arrow of God) \n \n6. The dominant subject of this passage is the \nA. white man\u2019s road B. new religion \nC. white man\u2019s influence D.  white man\u2019s weapons. \n7. According to the passage, the people of Umuaro and Okperi \nA. are friends B. are only acquaintances \nC. are no friends D. can never be enemies. \n8. \u2018There is no escape from the white man\u2019 in the passage \nmeans that the \nA. white man will send the people to prison \nB. white man can kill all the people with his gun \nC. people are only trying to run away from the white \nman \nD. people must accept the white man. \n9. \u2018Passes by your  ears\u2019 in the passage means \nA. piercing through your ears. \nB. listening eagerly \nC. making no impression \nD. accepting as the truth. \n10. Unachukwu\u2019s speech in this passage shows that he \nA. is a coward B. wants his people to suffer \nC. loves the white man D. is wise with experience. \nPASSAGE III \nManager:  Mr. Mbu, I would not describe you as an inefficient worker, \nI therefore find it difficult to understand why the Conference \nRoom is so untidy, in spite of the fact that I had reminded \nyou of the meeting scheduled to take place there this afternoon. \nSecretary:  Sir, I did instruct the cleaner to tidy up the \nplace before the meeting. \nManager:  Are you trying to hold the cleaner responsible \nfor the untidy condition of the  room? \nSecretary:  Partly, Sir, I gave him an instruction which he \nfailed to carry out. It is  certainly my intention \nto make a formal complaint against him for \ndereliction of duty. \nManager: And would you wash your hands off any \nblame after that? Do you  think that just making \na formal complaint against the cleaner absolves \nyou of all blame? When do you consider an \nassignment as properly executed: when the \nexecution is properly supervised or not?  Was \nit sufficient for you to give instructions to the \ncleaner without ensuring that he actually \ncarried them out? \nSecretary: Sir, I do not see what else I could have done, \nshort of doing the job myself. The cleaner is a \nsix-footer and I could not have intimidated \nhim physically. \nManager : I see, I await your formal complaint against \nthe cleaner, but I shall not forget that you \nallowed a board meeting to take place in an \nuntidy Conference Room. \n1 1. The relationship between the manager and his secretary, \nas revealed in the passage, could be said to be \nA. strained B. charged C.  personal D. cordial. \n1 2. \u2018I would not describe you as an inefficient worker\u2026\u2019 \nSuggests that the manager \nA. is quite pleased with the level of diligence of his \nsecretary. \nB.  has had cause in the past to complain against his \nsecretary \nC.  is dissatisfied with the level of performance of his \nsecretary \nD. is non-commital over the efficiency of his  secretary. \n1 3. It would appear that the manager feels that the secretary \nA. should have, if possible, personally cleaned the \nConference Room. \nB.  should have ensured that someone else cleaned \nthe Conference Room \nC. should have ensured that the cleaner did his  job \nD. is a coward \n1 4. The secretary\u2019s attitude seems to  be \nA. Manager Sir, you employed this huge and \nrecalcitrant cleaner and I am not going to do his job for him. \nB. \u2018It is not the duty o f a secretary to enforce the \ninstructions he gives to his junior workers\u2019 \nC. \u2018I am a secretary by profession, not a cleaner  \nD. \u2018It is not terribly important how tidy the \nConference Room is for the meeting. \n1 5. The last comment by the manager suggests that he \nA. is going to hold the secretary responsible for \nwhat has happened \nB. is likely to reprimand both the secretary and \nthe cleaner for dereliction of  duty \nC. will punish the cleaner but warn the  secretary \nD. will warn the cleaner and punish he secretary. \nPASSAGE IV \nPrimitive man was probably more concerned with fire as a \nsource of warmth and as a means of light. Before he discovered \nless laborious ways of making fire, he had to preserve it, and \nwhenever he went on a journey he carried a firebrand with him. \nHis discovery that the firebrand, from which the torch may well",
