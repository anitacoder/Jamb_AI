  "content": "1. The presence of a wide variety of edible items in Jos \nsuggests that \nA. the inhabitants are great farmers and \ninnovators  \nB. the soil is extremely fertile and receptive \nC. there is a high influx of traders and farmers \nfrom other places \nD. it rains all the year round in the city and its \nenvirons \n2. The benevolence of Jos climate is reflected in the \nA. feeling of peace and harmony with nature \nwhich the city evokes \nB. cold climate of the city which makes people \nalways dress warmly \nC. fact that the inhabitants of Jos do not need to \nwork hard \nD. average life-span of the inhabitants of Jos, \nwhich is high. \n3. One distinctive ecological feature symbolizing the close \nintimacy between Jos and nature, is the \nA. bright horizon adorning the cityfrom everyangle \nB. rocky hills standing at various points of the city \nlike castles \nC. sun which shines over Jos with benevolence \nD. clouds which spread a blanket of protection \nbetween the sun and the earth. \n4. The last paragragh of the passage suggests that \nA. the colonialists left Jos only after a fight \nB. the colonialists left Jos reluctantly \nC. Jos could not contain the many colonialists \nD. Nigeria\u2019s independence forced many \ncolonialists out of Jos. \n \n5. \u2018The heat of Jos dances caressingly on the surface of \nthe skin as if afraid to hurt the organs beneath\u2019 this \nmeans in Jos it is \nA. never hot B. always cold C. never uncomfortable \nD. always warm. \nPASSAGE II \nPopulation has at last made the grade and emerged as a \nworld problem. Unfortunately, most of those who speak or write \nabout it persist in thinking of it in terms of a race between human \nnumbers and world resources especially of food - a kind of \ncompetition between production and reproduction. \nCertainly, the statistics churned out are important \nrevealing that indeed, there is a population explosion. But the \nreal explosion is a twentieth century phenomenon, due primarily \nto the spectacular development in medicine and hygiene. This \nhas drastically cut down death rates without any corresponding \nreduction in birth rates; death control without birth control. \nWorld population we are told has more than doubled since 1900 \nand will certainly reach well over 5\u00bd billion and possibly 7 billion \nby the magical year 2000. \nThe population has brought us up against a number of \ntough ecological facts. Man is at last pressing hard on his spatial \nenvironment - there is little leeway left for his colonization of \nnew areas of the world\u2019s surface\u2026 \nWhat are people for? Surely people do not exist just to \nprovided \u2018 bomb-fodder\u2019 for an atomic bonfire or \u2018religious fodder\u2019 \nfor rival religion sects or \u2018cannon-fodder\u2019 for rival national armies \nor rival political parties or even consumer-fodder\u2019 for profit \nmaking systems. It cannot be their aim just to eat, drink and be \nmerry and to hell with posterity nor to live  out  their \nundernourished lives in some squalid Asian or African village. \nMan\u2019s dominant aim must be to increase in quality-quality \nof human personality, of achievement, of inner experience, quality \nof life and of living in general. Fulfillment is probably the \nembracing word; more \u2018fulfillment\u2019 more satisfaction and less \nfrustration for more Homo sapiens. Man wants more varied and \nfuller achievement in the society as opposed to drabness and \nshrinkages. We want more knowledge and more interest as \nagainst ignorance and apathy. Then would we know that the \nspatial environment is not as small as we think. \n \n6. The theme of the passage is \nA. population explosion and development in medicine \nB. man in a deprived world \nC. development in medicine and hygiene \nD. population and the need for qualitative development. \n \n7. Population explosion is as a result of \nA. cut down in death rates and birth rates \nB. lack of birth control and child welfare \nC. development in environmental sanitation \nD. imbalance between death control and birth \ncontrol. \n \n8. According to the passage, population explosion has \nbrought man up against the ecological facts of \nA. man\u2019s inhumanity to man, hunger and deprivation \nB. pressing hard on the little available space \nC. little leeway of man\u2019s colonization of people \nD. squalid African villages. \n \n9. According to the passage, the main purpose of human \nexistences is \nA. for procreation \nB. to provide cannon-fodder \nC. to live perpetually in penury \nD. to live a life of fulfillment. \n \n10. \u2018Little leeway\u2019 can be replaced with \nA. not much extra space B. no extra space \nC.    plenty of space D. scarcely any space. \n \nPASSAGE III \nThere is another interesting fact about eye movement. \nIf you record the eye movements of someone who is reading \nyou will notice that from time to time the reader goes back and \nlooks again at something he has read before; in other words, he \nregresses to an earlier part of the text probably because he \nrealises he does not understand the passage properly. Then he \ncomes back to where he left off and continues reading. At one \ntime, it was thought that regression was a fault, but it is a fact a \nvery necessary activity in efficient reading. \nThere are several different kinds of fault in reading, \nwhich are usually more exaggerated with foreign learners. The \nmost common one is that most people read more slowly than \nthey should. There is no rate at which people ought to read of \ncourse; it depends on your purpose in reading, how difficult the \nlanguage is, how unfamiliar the material is and so on. But most \npeople read everything at the same slow speed and do not seem \nto realise that they can read faster or slower as required. Other \npeople say the words to themselves or move their lips - these \nhabits slow the reader down to something near speaking speed, \nwhich is of course much slower than reading speed. Another \nhabit which can slow you down is following the line with your \nfinger, or with a pen.",
