Each question carries 3 marks. \n \nPASSAGE I \nThe emergence of a standard dialect produces \nthephenomenon known as \u201caccent\u201d which is quite different from \ndialect. In the process of learning a foreign language, it is normal \nto transfer the patterns of an indigenous language to those of \nthe foreign language. With time, however, those of form and \nmost of those of orthography and phonology gradually get \neliminated. This is because these can easily be identified and \ncorrected. They are easy to correct because they do not involve \npatterns of muscular movement. It is also necessary to correct \nthem because otherwise they could seriously impair intelligibility. \nWith phonetic patterns, on the other hand, there is a \n \n  Use of English 2001  \n \n \n \n \ngreat deal of intelligibility tolerance because muscular patterns \nare involved, thus making corrections difficult when observed. \nBesides, phonetic patterns do not impair intelligibility much. \nHence the transference of phonetic habits from one language to \nanother is both easier to tolerate and more difficult to avoid \nthan transference at the lexico-grammatical level. It follows that \na speaker who is learning a second dialect does so with an \naccent since the muscles of his speech organs would have \ncrystallized in response to the phonetics of his native language \nwhich he learnt first. The speaker therefore speaks the second \ndialect with the phonetic features of his native dialect. The \nlearning of a standard language is simply the learning of a second \ndialect \u2013 that which has been standardized. \n \nMembers of a language community control at least two \ndialects and use both dialects in different situations. In the rural \nareas, the native dialect is used in most situations since there is \nless movement. Therefore, rural dwellers tend to be parochial \nand maintain the homogeneity of their dialect. In the urban \ncommunity, on the other hand, there is more demand on the \nstandard dialect th an on the rural one. This is because people \nfrom different regions converge here. In order to ensure mutual \nintelligibility resulting from the pressure of communication, a \ngreat deal of demand is made on the standard dialect which now \nbecomes the lingua franca amongst them. \n \n1.
