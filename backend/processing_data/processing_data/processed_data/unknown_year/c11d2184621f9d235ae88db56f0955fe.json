In primitive societies, the men were \nassigned the roles of going out to hunt, fish \nand fight off the hostile tribe next door while \nthe women did the housekeeping and minded \nthe children. The men were believed to be \nsuperior to the women in physical strength and \ncapability. There was a controversy in these \nsocieties as to what the roles of the sexes \nshould be. Consequently, primitive societies \nenjoyed great stability. However, with the ad- \nvan cement of civilization, many of the special \nprivileges traditionally enjoyed by men began \nto be eroded one after another. There is hardly \nany sphere of human Endeavour in which \nwomen have not gained a firm foothold: there \nare women doctors, engineers, pilots, prime \nministers, judges, bankers and so on. Today, \nthe women's spheres of operation are no longer \nrestricted to the home; she is successfully \ncompeting with her counterpart in every area \nof human activity. But has this development \nbeen an unqualified blessing to the society? \n \nTo answer this question, let us examine some \nof the problems created in the process of \nachieving women's emancipation. First, a large \nnumber of women including the married ones \nand mothers now take up paid employment. \nThe conditions attached to such employment \nmake it extremely difficult if not impossible for \nthem to take adequate care of their children at \nhomes. Since no one serve two masters, the \nhealth and education of the children suffer \ntremendously. \n \nAdapted from Ukwuegbe C., et al (2006) \nCATCH-Up English Language for SSCEMME, \nIbadan: Heinemann Educational Books \n(Nigeria) PLC. \n \n1. Advantages usually enjoyed by men \nbegan to \n(d) fade with wide self-realization \n \n2. According to the passage, what two masters \nare women struggling to serve? \n \n(a) The health and education of their children \n(b) The husband and the children \n(C) The office and the husband \n(d) The office and the home \n \n3. According to the passage, ancient societies \nwere secured because \n \n(a) men were assigned superior roles \n(b) the tasks of women and men were outlined \n(c) women accepted inferior roles interpreted \nthe roles of women were commonly interpreted \n(d) the roles of women were commonly \ninterpreted \n \n4. From the passage, it can be inferred that \nwomen emancipation results in \n \n(a) women becoming covertly ambitious \n(b) resentment of men by gain women \n(c) crises at tome \n(d) men becoming nonchalant. \n \n5. The phrase suffer tremendously, as used in \nthe passage, means \n \n(a) greatly disadvantaged \n(b) to become worse \n(c) badly unpleased \n(d) badly affected \n \nPASSAGE II \n \nThe passage below has gaps.
