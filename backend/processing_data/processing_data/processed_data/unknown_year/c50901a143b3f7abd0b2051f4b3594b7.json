He was not saying that men do not differ from one \nanother in the powers and dimensions of their bodies, minds \nand characters. He was asserting that, despite variations and \ndifferences, they all possessed the right to equal political and \nlegal treatment. We must, however, ask of what real value are \npolitical and legal equality to a man who has no bread to eat, no \nclothes to wear, no roof to shelter him, no chance to earn a \nlivelihood? What we understand as democratic society must \nprovide for its citizen\u2019s minimum status as a member of that \nsociety, that keeps him from becoming a beggar, outcast or outlaw \nand that offers him some protection in his deprivation, losses \nand fears. \nIn our time, the nations of the democratic world have \ninstalled elaborate systems of social security and welfare, ranging \nfrom compensation for industrial accidents to subsidized \nhousing, unemployment insurance, old age pensions, to provide \nagainst the characteristic losses and disasters of human life. \nThe evolving status of the Negro in America is \nattracting the attention of the champions of equality. Much has \nbeen written on the wrongs, injustices and inequalities of the \ncoloured citizen of the USA and much remains to be said, because \nthe history of this struggle for human rights is still unfolding. \n[John Coghlan] \n \n6. It could be deduced from the passage that \nA. citizens haveequal political and legal treatment in America \nB.  the nations of the democratic world have no political \nand legal hierarchy \nC. democratic nations are expanding the provision of \nsocial welfare. \nD. equality obliterates differences and variations among \nraces and nations. \n \n7. According to the passage, a democratic nation is one which \n9. From the passage, it is obvious that \nA. there is a hierarchy of rights \nB. all men possess the right to equal political affiliations \nC. there is deprivation in the society \nD. the negro in America are champions of equality. \n \n10. A suitable title for the passage is \nA. Democracy \nB. Discrimination \nC. Equality \nD. Freedom \nPASSAGE III \nIn many places in the world today, the poor are getting \npoorer while the rich are getting richer, and the programmes of \ndevelopment planning and foreign aid appear to be unable to \nreverse this trend. Nearly all the developing countries have a \nmodern sector, where the patterns of living and working are \nsimilar to those in developed countries. But they also have a \nnon-modern sector, where the patterns of living and working are \nnot only unsatisfactory, but in many cases are even getting \nworse. \nWhat is the typical condition of the poor in developing \ncountries? Their work opportunities are so limited that they \ncannot work their way out of their situation . They are \nunderemployed, or totally unemployed; when they do find \noccasional work, their productivity is extremely low. Some of \nthem have land, but often too little land. Many have no land, \nand no prospect of ever getting any. There is no hope for them \nin the rural areas and so, they drift into the big cities. But there is \nno work for them in the big cities either -- and of course no \nhousing. All the same, they flock into the cities because their \nchances of finding some work appear to be greater there than in \nthe villages \u2013 where they are nil. Rural unemployment, then, \nproduces mass -migration into the cities; rural unemployment \nbecomes urban unemployment. \nThe problem can be stated quite simply: what can be \ndone to promote economic growth outside the big cities, in the \nsmall towns and villages, w hich still contain 80 to 90% of the \ntotal population? The primary need is work places, literally \nmillions of workplaces. \n \n11. The expression \u2018work their way out of their situation\u2019 \nmeans. \nA. walk from one village to another \nB. migrate from village to city \nC. work their way out of their village \nD. change their circumstances. \n \n12. Where are the rich getting richer and the poor poorer? \nA. In nearly all developing countries. \nB. In a majority of countries in the world.",
