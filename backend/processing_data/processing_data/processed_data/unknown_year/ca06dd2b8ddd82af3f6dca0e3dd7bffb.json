Yes, gossip is universal. In some languages, it \nmay have an outright negative connotation but in English, it \nbasically means \u2018idle talk\u2019, chat about trivial things or matters. \nWhen moderate and kind, \u2018casual talk\u2019 may serve to exchange \nuseful information as a means of updating one\u2019s knowle dge. \nThe whole neighborhood may grow gossipy with who got \nmarried, pregnant, died, or it may just be a humorous chitchat \ndevoid of malicious intent. \nHowever, idle talk more often than not, degenerates \nbeyond the bounds of propriety and good taste. Facts get \nembellished, exaggerated or deliberately distorted. Humiliation \nis made the source of humour, privacy is violated, confidences \nbetrayed and reputations injured or ruined. Condemnation takes \nthe place of commendation, murmuring and fault fi nding are \nextolled. The end result is like the mud thrown on a clean piece \nof white cloth. It does not stick but it leaves a dirty and sometimes \npermanent stain behind. \nGossip has been blamed for sleepless nights, heartache \nand indigestion. Certainly, it must have caused you some \npersonal anguish at one time or the other, that is someone must \nat some time have tried getting a knife between your shoulder \nblades. Negative gossip is almost universally frowned upon. \nAmong the Indians in the United States, gossiping about \nsomeone is classified with lying and stealing. Among the Yoruba \nof Nigeria, the tale bearer is detested and often avoided. Indeed, \nthroughout history, measures have been taken to curb this \n\u2018deadly\u2019 disease. Between the 15th and 18th centuries, the ducking \nstool was popularly used in England and Germany and later in \nthe United States. \nThe gossip was tied to a chair and repeatedly ducke d \nin water. In modern times, the war against gossiping has also \nbeen fought. Rumour control centres have been established to \nrespond to rumours that were potentially harmful to government \nactivities. Laws have even passed to curb gossip. Nicknames \nhave been given to those who peddle the trade. Ever heard of \n\u2018Amebo\u2019! \nSuch efforts notwithstanding, gossip survives. It is \nalive and flourishing. Gossip is everywhere. There is \nneighbourhood gossip, office gossip. Shop gossip, party gossip, \nfamily gossip and funnily enough religious gossip. Gossip \ntranscends all cultures, races and civilizations, and it has \nflourished and is still flourishing at every level of society. Gossip \nis deeply a part of human nature. Yet gossip is not inherently \nevil. There is a positive side to casual talk. Knowing where to \ndraw the line between harmless and harmful gossip is the key to \navoiding victimizing others and being a victim yourself. \n \n1. Gossip appeals to people because \nA. it is entertaining but could be deadly \nB. human being take delight in passing and \nacquiring  information \n2. \u2018Grow gossipy\u2019 as used in the passage, means the area \nA. cultivates and controls gossip \nB. is a rumour mill \nC. is ruined by gossip \nD. engages in fruitful talk. \n \n3.

Which title best sums up this passage? \nA. gossip: a thing of the past \nB. gossip: a societal evil \nC. gossip and be damned \nD. gossip: the good and the bad. \n \nPASSAGE II \nIn many places in the world today, the poor are getting \npoorer while the rich are getting richer, and the programmes of \ndevelopment planning and foreign aid appear to be unable to \nreverse this trend. Nearly all the developing countries. But they \nalso have a non-modern sector, where the patterns of living and \nworking are not only unsatisfactory, but in many cases are even \ngetting worse. What is typical condition of the poor in developing \ncountries? Their work opportunities are so limited that they \ncannot work their way out of their situation. They are under- \nemployed, or totally unemployed. When they do find occasional \nwork, their productivity is extremely low. Some of them have \nland, but often too little land. Many have no land, and no prospect \nof ever getting any. There is no big cities either - and of course \nno housing. All the same, they flock into cities because their \nchances of finding some work appear to be greater there than in \nthe villages-where such chances are nil. Rural employment then \nproduces mass migration into the cities. Rural unemployment \nbecomes urban unemployment. \nThe problem can be stated quite simply: what can be \ndone to promote economic growth in the small towns and villages, \nwhich still contain about eighty to ninety percent of the \npopulation? The primary need is workplaces, literally millions of \nworkplaces. No one, of course, would suggest that output per \nworker is unimportant. But the primary aim cannot be to maximize \noutput per worker; it must be to maximize work opportunities for \nthe unemployed and the under-employed. The poor man\u2019s \ngreatest need is the chance to work. Even poorly paid and \nrelatively unproductive work is better than no work at al l. It is \ntherefore more important that everybody should produce",
