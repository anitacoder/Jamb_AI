To leave the country \u2018for good\u2019 means leaving the \ncountry  \nA. unexpectedly \nB. for better opportunities \nC. permanently \nD. now that things are not very good \n \n2.  The expression \u2018each striving to be recognized as being \nthe most cogent\u2019 means each \nA. trying to prove its superiority \nB. determined to prove that it is the most \nacceptable \nC. resolved not to be dislodged \nD. attempting to show that it is the brightest. \n \n3. The writer\u2019s argument that it is foolhardy to offer one\u2019s \nservices where such are apparently not required implies \nthat in Nigeria \nA. the authorities do not solicit for the services \nof the citizens \nB. mediocrity is the order of the day \nC. the authorities are indifferent to offers of help \nfrom the citizens \nD. to offer to serve the country is dangerous. \n \n4. The writer\u2019s posture as to who caused the problems in \nhis country can be described as \nA. indifferent B. unpatriotic \nC. self-righteousness  D. logical. \n \n5. The last paragraph of the passage reveals that \nA. the writer is a member of the elite which alone \nindulges in this king of thinking \nB. people in the country only end up arguing \namong themselves, while nobody does \nanything about the situation \nC. the majority of citizens in the country do not \npossess  the ability to argue the way the writer \ndoes \nD. deciding to leave the country is as bad as \ndeciding to stay. \n \nPASSAGE II \nThe development of science and technology in this \ncentury had led men into many inventions and discoveries. For \nnearly a century, men were content with the use of railways, \ncarriages and cars. Another chapter opened whe n steamships \nand airplanes were invented. Thus, through technology, man \nconquered the land, the water and the airspace. But there was \none area left unconquered by man: outer space. In fact, outer \nspace --- planets, stars and the galaxies --- was known only  \nthrough magnifying lenses. Thus, man operated on mere \nconjectures as far as knowledge of these things was concerned. \nConsequently, there was no scientific certainty, only hypotheses. \nBut today, man has penetrated outer space. \nIt is true that science and technology have developed \ntremendously in this century. In the field of engineering, for \nexample, the automobile has been invented as a means of easier, \nmore comfortable and faster movement from one place to another. \nApart from that, methods and instruments for diagnosing \ndiseases and promoting hygiene and sanitation have helped to \nreduce mortality rate and improve living conditions. In the field \nof electronics, the invention of the computer is a remarkable \nachievement. The use of computers in economic activities, \neducation, administration and business has helped to reduce \nthe exertion of human energy as more activities can be carried \nout faster and more effectively. \nHowever, in spite of the laudable contributions and \nlofty accomplishments of technology, it has, nevertheless, \nsucceeded in introducing several anomalies and, in some cases, \nreduced the value attached to human life. In our age, social life \nhas been greatly altered by technolog ical changes such as the \ninvention of nuclear energy. Those who support the invention \nof nuclear energy claim that the only way to maintain peace is to \nbe battle-ready. Humanity is greatly threatened and terrorized \nby the invention of the nuclear warhead. People now live in \ndread of the hour, as no one knows when a conflict may arise \nbetween nations, which may lead to the use of the nuclear bomb \nassumed to possess the capacity of wiping out humanity within \nthe twinkling of an eye. \n \n6. The phrase \u2018For nearly a century\u2019 implies that the events \ndescribed happened \nA. after the present century \nB. before the present century \nC. at a time that includes the present century \nD. before the development of science and \ntechnology. \n \n7. The words \u2018conjectures\u2019 and \u2018hypotheses\u2019 mean \nA. guess-work B. prediction \nD. understanding  D. conclusion \n \n8. The inventors of nuclear energy justify the need for it \nby saying that it will \nA. make people fear war and thus create peace \nB. enable wars to be fought more effectively \nC. provide a balance of power between war and \npeace \nD. balanced society in the world. \n \n9. The conclusion one can draw from the passage is that the \ndirection of the development of science and technology \nA. has continued to be of benefit to humanity \nB. leaves nothing more to be invented or \ndiscovered \nC. may lead man back to the early periods \nD. has assumed some negative dimensions. \n \n10. The title that best reflects the contents of the passage is \nA. Man, Science and the Environment \nB. Technology in the Service of Man \nC. Science and Technology through the \nCenturies \nD. Science, Technology and Human Existence. \n \nPASSAGE III \nStandard English refers to the authoritative and correct \nusage of the language, the medium of expression for government \nand education. Its opposite is a dialectal variant of the language, \nthat is, accepted and recognized words, expressions and \nstructures peculiar to a smaller group of language users who are \ngenerally set apart from standard usage by cultural group or",
