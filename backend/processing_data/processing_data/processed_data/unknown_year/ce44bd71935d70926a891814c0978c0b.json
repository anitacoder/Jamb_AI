Traditional religion has waned in Nigeria \nowing to the \n(a) influence of Islam over Bori spirits \n(b) influence of Christianity over local oracles \n(c) decline of the interest in traditional religions \n(d) influence of non-traditional religions. \n \n5. Which factor is common to all traditional \nreligions as mentioned in the passage? \n(a) Prayer only. \n(b) Divination. \n(c) Sacrifice only. \n(d) Rituals. \n \nPASSAGE II \nRecently, literally research reveals that \nNigerians hardly have time to read. In essence, \nthe reading culture in Nigeria is now at a low \nebb. It is disturbing, however, that the few \nNigerians that read concentrates on foreign \nbooks than indigenous productions. Most \nNigerian authors of novels, storybooks, fiction \nand non-fiction series have decried, on \ndifferent occasions, their woes. They were \nbitter in the way most owners of bookshops \nand publishers treat them. It was gathered that \nmost renowned bookshops in Nigeria hardly sell \nbooks written by indigenous authors. They \npreferred to stock foreign books. When \ncontacted by DAILY INDEPENDENT, the general \nmanager of popular bookstore in Lagos Island \ndeclared that most of the bookshops preferred \nto stock foreign books because of higher \ndemands for them, the question that bothers \nmost Nigerian authors is, while their overseas \ncounterparts are being rewarded with great \ninternational honours, why are Nigerians not \naccording them such recognition in their own \ncountry? \n \nRecently, Nigerian novelist, Chimamanda \nNgozi Adichie won the 2007 Orange Prize \nAward, the literary world\u2019s top award for fiction \nin English written by women. The award carries \na prize tag of $30,000. It was reported \nin Publishers Weekly, Half of a Yellow Sun, the \nbook that earned her the award, was \nprofoundly gripping. According to the reviewer, \nthe book is a \u2018transcendent novel of many \ndescriptive triumph, most notably its diction of \nthe impact of war brutalities on peasant and \nintellectuals alike. It is a searing history in \nfictional form, intensely evocative and \nimmensely absorbing\u2019. Chinua Achebe, \u2018Father \nof Modern African Literature\u2019, also won the \nsecond ever Man Booker international \u2018Prize of \n\u2015\u00a360,000 with his first novel Things Fall Apart, \npublished in 1958.\u2019 When Professor Wole \nSoyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature in \n1986, the fame confirmed the relevance of \nNigerians in the world of classical excellence. \nBen Okri won the 1991 Booker Prize with his \nwork, The Famished Road, and the world \ncelebrated Nigeria as the giant of Africa. \n \nIt was also gathered that most of the \npublishers hurriedly produce books and in the \nprocess marred their good contents. Most of \nthe books are not properly edited and actually \nbecome substandard when compared with the \nforeign products. The extent to which book \npublishing standard has fallen in Nigerian is \nalarming. Often Nigerian publishers have been \nblamed for this. It is instructive that none of \nthe books mentioned had been published in \nNigerian. It was discovered that most students \nin tertiary institutions depends on dictations \nfrom their lecturers and/or handouts. A science \nlecturer in one of the Nigerian universities, who \nhad been a victim of handout sales scandal, \ntold DAILY INDEPENDENT the reality of campus \nchallenges in relation to books. \u2018I was to dictate \nnotes slowly to students who hung on every \nword in the absence of textbooks in a library \nthat had, to all intent and purpose, stopped \nbuying new books when the local currency \ndevalued. But what other alternative does one \nhave? \nAdapted from DAILY INDEPENDENT, Monday, 20 August, \n2007",
