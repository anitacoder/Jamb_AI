I \nam reminded of the popular slogan that this country belongs to \nus all\u2019, for which reason every Nigerian must join hands in trying \nto salvage it. I try to dismiss the argument by reasoning that it is \nfoolhardy attempting to lend a helping hand where one\u2019s services \nare apparently not required. Then I am reminded that if I left the \ncountry in a hurry just because of our political instability and \neconomic hardships, my commitments to my family at home would \nsuffer. I reply by saying that as soon as I got settled abroad, I \nwould arrange for my family to join me. Other financial problems \nat home would be taken care of by my regular remittances. Would \nI then never think of going back home in future? Not until the \nsituation in the country improved considerably, I would answer. \nAnd who did I expect to carry on with the task of national \nrehabilitation when the likes f me are all out of the country? \nThose who messed up the country in the first place, I would \nargue. And so on. This dialogue of self has been going on for \nthe last ten years or so; meanwhile, I am yet to leave the country. \nWhen I wonder how many people share my kind of \nmental experience, realize that we must be very few. For not \nmany have the slightest opportunity of absconding from the \ncountry; they do not have the place to run to, nor do they have \nthe means of escape. Even among the elite who consider this",
