When the slope of the total utility curve is \ndeclining, the marginal utility of a consumer \nwill be increasing if he \nA. stops consuming more of the commodity \nB. reduces the quantity consumed \nC. increases the quantity consumed \nD. consumes more of another commodity \n \nUse the diagram below to answer question \n13 and 14 \n \n \n \n13. The consumer is at equilibrium at point \nA. N \nB. P \nC. M \nD. K \n \n14. To move from point M to K, the consumer \nhas to increase the \nA. consumption of X and reduce the \nconsumption of Y \nB. expenditure on Y \nC. expenditure on X \nD. consumption of Y and reduce \nthe consumption of X \n \n15. The supply of cocoa is influenced by \nA. seasonal conditions \nB. the efficacy of fertilizer used \nC. the demand for beverages \nD. the availability of close substitutes \n \n16. If quantity supplied is constant irrespective of \nprice changes, the supply elasticity is \nA. unitary \nB. infinity \nC. fairly elastic \nD. perfectly inelastic \n \n17. The cost elasticity of supply is a useful \ninstrument for measuring \nA. profit \nB. productivity \nC. national income \nD. price index \n \n18. The invisible hand promotes the interests of \nA. consumers \nB. society \nC. government \nD. producers \n \n19.
