This becomes more understandable \nif one consi\nders the teeming population of youths seeking admission into these \ntertiary institutions. Hitherto, each institution used to conduct entrance \nexaminations in line with their autonomous s\ntatus. This process was called\n \nconcessional admission. It was in 1978 \nthat the Federal Government of Nigeria \nestablished the Joint Admission\ns\n \nMatriculation Board (JAMB) to harmonize \nadmissions into tertiary institution\ns in Nigeria. This paper undertook\n \na \nhistorical evaluation of JAMB\u2019s efficiency in the conduct of entrance \ne\nxaminations in Nigeria, 1978\n-\n2019. Historical descriptive design was adopted\n.\n \nFifteen \nstaff\n,\n \napplicants and students were sampled from fifteen tertiary \ninstitutions and their host communities in South Western geo\n-\npolitical zone of \nNigeria. A structured que\nstionnaire titled \u201cQuestionnaire on Historical \nEvaluation of JAMB Efficiency in the Conduct of Entrance Examinations in \nNigeria\u201d (QHEJECEEN) was used\n. The data obtained were analyzed using\n \nANOVA\n \nas the statistical tool\n. It was revealed that examination mal\npractices \nremain a formidable task before JAMB. In view of the foregoing\n, it was \nrecommended \nthat the nation should urgently come to the rescue of JAMB to \ncurb examination malpractices.\n \n \nKey\nwords\n: Efficiency, examination, evaluation, admission, tertiary \nin\nstitutions.\n \n \nReceived: 25\n \nApril 2019\n \n \n                  \n               \nAccepted:\n \n20\n \nJuly 2019",
