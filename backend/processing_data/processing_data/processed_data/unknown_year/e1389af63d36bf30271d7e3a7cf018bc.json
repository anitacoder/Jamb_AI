Surely the largest single \napplication process for entry into educational institutions in the world since larger nations have regionalized the process.   \nThe Board has radically improved a lot of processes in the 2020 UTME and Direct Entry applications, the Brochure and Syllabus  were redesigned \nto improve richness of the look and feel, coupled with new media including videos, charts and links to various parts of the Brochure and Syllabus.   \nThis year, we have gone further to enhance the ability of the candidate to access the Integrated Brochure And Syllabus System  (IBASS) whilst \nincreasing the channels of access and interraction. The interactive electronic c opy of the Brochure and Syllabus are now available on the JAMB \nwebsite at www.jamb.gov.ng/ibass/ and can also be downloaded to Android smart phones using the link provided on the IBASS webpage above.   \nJAMB also has noticed the inability of candidates to a ccurately identify the appropriate requirements for various Programmes of Study before \nfilling the JAMB application forms. Also, one of the major improvements this year is the  ability of candidates to ident ify eligibility for various \nProgrammes by supplying either O\u2019Level or A\u2019Level results into the eligibility form online on the IBASS link available on the JAMB website.   \nIn summary, the 2020 JAMB BROCHURE has the following features for the benefits of candidates:  \n1. Online and mobile app (android) version apart from the CD version of the JAMB Brochure  \n2. An interactive Eligibility Checker to guide candidates on institutions and courses they are eligible to apply for using their O\u2019level or A\u2019level \nsubjects and UTME subjects.  \n3. CBT Exams guide and Demo Exams to guide candidates on the process on the exams.  \n4. Exams Rules and Regulations  \n5. Recommended books  \n6. Study tips and hints to guide candidates on how to prepare for the exams  \n7. Contact offices, email or phone numbers for enquiries and support  \nIn reaching out to candidates, the Board publishes essential information/guidelines in the Brochure. The Brochure provides ca ndidates with \ndetailed information on Programmes with their basi c and specific entry requirements leading to the award of First Degree, National Diploma, \nNational Innovation Diploma and Nigeria Certificate in Education in Tertiary Institutions in Nigeria.",
