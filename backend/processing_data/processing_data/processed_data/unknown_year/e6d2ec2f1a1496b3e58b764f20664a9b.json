The first striking thing to notice, perhaps, is \nthe benevolence of the climate. It will be no exaggeration to say \nthat in no other Nigerian city does one feel so much at peace, so \nrelaxed, with the climate as in Jos. When people say that Jos is \ncool, the remark is always a compliment, referring to the cool, \nserene feeling of being at peace with nature, which one \nexperiences in the city. This feeling is topographically symbolized \nby the surrounding rocky hills, which adorn the horizon from \nevery angle of the city. These hills remind you of castles, excepts \nthat whereas castles are man-made, the hills of Jos are natural \nedifices in which the master mason who had delicately laid those \nstones one upon another is no other than God Himself. The sun \nof Jos shines without malice, and even in February and March, \nwhen it is scorching hot in most parts of Nigeria, the heat of Jos \ndances charmingly on the surface of the skin, as if afraid of \nhurting the organs beneath. It is as if from above a soft protective \n \n \nlayer of blanket intercedes between the heat of the sun and the \ninhabitants of the city. \nCompared to what obtains in most other Nigerian cities, \nthe inhabitants of Jos are openly warm. They are relaxed, and \nthere is the absence of that suffocating feeling, with which a \nplace likes Lagos is associated, of a people madly  rushing to \ntheir graves. The groceries operating at all nooks and crannies \nof the city give the impression of a great abundance of a variety \nof food items. It is almost as if some unseen hands are responsible \nfor the presence of these varieties of edible items. The truth of \ncourse is that, in Jos, people - civil servants, farmers and traders \n\u2013 are socially well-disposed to the influx of the new settlers and \nnovel ideas and this ensures an apparent high degree of self - \nsufficiency. You may be hungry in Jos, but you need not be \nangry. \nIf other parts of Nigeria had been like Jos, surely the \ncolonialists would never have left the country without a good \nfight. Many monuments abound in  the city, which tell tales of \nthe Whiteman\u2019s love for this city of solid minerals.",
