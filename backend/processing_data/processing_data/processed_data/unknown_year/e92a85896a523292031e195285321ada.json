  "content": "factual material of a report rather than the personalities involved. \nSo they worked to remove the human being from their writing. \nImpersonal writing style was the result. By impersonal writing is \nmeant writing in the third person \u2013 without I\u2019s, we\u2019s or you\u2019s. \nIn recent years, impersonal writing has been \nstrenuously questioned by many writers. These writers point \nout that personal writing is more forceful and direct than is \nimpersonal writing. They contend that writing which brings both \nreader and writer into the picture is more like conversation and \ntherefore more interesting. And they answer to the point on \nobjectivity with a reply that objectivity is an attitude of mind \nand not a matter of person. A report, they say, can be just as \nobjective when written in personal style as when in impersonal \nstyle. Frequently, they counter with the argument that impersonal \nwriting leads to an overuse of passive voice and a generally dull \nwriting style. This last argument, however, lacks substance. \nImpersonal writing can and should be interesting. Any dullness \nit may have is wholly the fault of the writer. As proof, one has \nonly to look at the lively styles used by the writers for \nnewspapers, news magazines and journals. Most of this writing \nis impersonal \u2013 and usually it is not dull. \nAs in most cases of controversy, there is some merit to \nthe arguments on both sides. There are situations in which \npersonal writing is best. There are situations in which impersonal \nwriting is best. And there are situations in which either style is \nappropriate. The writer must decide at the outset of his work \nwhich style is best for his own situation. \nHis decision should be based on the circumstances of \neach report situation. First, he should consider the expectations \nor desires of those for whom he is preparing the report. More \nthan likely he will find a preference for impersonal style, for, like \nmost human beings, businessmen have been slow to break \ntradition. Next, the writer should consider the formality of the \nreport situation. If the situation Is informal, as when the report is \nreally a personal communication of information between business \nassociates, personal writing is appropriate. But if the situation is \nformal, as is the case with most reports, the conventional \nimpersonal style is best. \nLesikar, R. V.: Report Writing for Business \n \n \n11. One argument given in support of personal writing is \nthat it \nA. has informal features which make it more \ndiverting than impersonal writing \nB. makes writers more focused and less boring \nC. can be more objective than impersonal writing \nD. is the style to use in all situations involving \nbusinessmen.  \n \n12. Which of the following statements is true according to \nthe passage? \nA. The impersonal style helps to achieve a \nmeasure of objectivity in report writing. \nB. The impersonal style has been widely \nacclaimed. \nC. Most report writing is characterized by the \nsparing use of the impersonal style. \nD. Most writers use the impersonal style to \nachieve objectivity in their reports. \n \n13. According to the passage, most of the writing in \nnewspapers, news magazines and journals \nA. personal and uninteresting \nB. personal and interesting \nC. impersonal and interesting \nD. impersonal and uninteresting. \n \n14. From the passage, what determines the appropriateness \nof a style is the \nA. theme B.  reader C. writer D. situation \n \n15. Which of the following best describes the writer of the \npassage?  \nA. He recognizes the need to be critical of report \nwriting. \nB. He cannot be said to be objective. \nC. He is being unnecessarily analytic. \nD. He is completely non-committal. \n \nPASSAGE IV \n \nThe passage below has gaps numbered 16 to 25. Immediately \nfollowing each gap, four options are provided. Choose the most \nappropriate option for each gap. Each question carries 2 marks. \n \nIt is the business of the scientist to accumulate \nknowledge about the universe and all that is in it, and to find, if \nhe is able, common \u202616\u2026  (A. approaches      B. instruments \nC. factors D. experiments ) which underlie and account for the \nfacts that he knows. He chooses, when he can, the method of \nthe controlled \u202617\u2026 (A. experiment   B. respondent  C. data \nD. system). If he wants to find out the effect of light on growing \nplants, he takes many plants, as alike as possible. Some he stands \nin the sun, some in the shade, some in the dark; all the time \nkeeping all other \u202618\u2026 (A. procedures  B. conditions C. studies \nD. objects) (temperature, moisture, nourishment) the same. In \nthis way, by keeping other variables\u202619\u2026 (A. dark B. constant \nC. good D. natural), and by varying the light only, the effect of \nlight on plants can be clearly seen.  This  \u202620\u2026   (A. method \nB. research C. tool D. rationale ) of using \u2018controls\u2019 can be \napplied to a variety of situations, and can be used to find the \nanswers to questions as widely different as \u2018must moisture be \npresent \u202621\u2026 (A. bar B. gold C. iron D. an alloy) is to rust?\u2019 \nand \u2018which variety of beans gives the greatest yield in one\u202622.. \n(A. period B. season c. climate D. weather)?\u2019 \nIn the course of his\u202623\u2026 (A.  inquiries  B. findings \nC. queries D. experiment), the scientist may find what he thinks \nis one common explanation for an increasing number of facts. \nThe explanation, if it seems consistently to fit the various facts, \nis called ..24\u2026 (A. a principle B. a thesis C. a hypothesis D. an \nantithesis). If this continues to stand the test of numerous \nexperiments and remains unshaken, it becomes a \u202625\u2026 (A. notion \nB. deduction C. law D. thesis). \n \nLEXIS, STRUCTUREAND ORALFORMS \n \n(Questions 26 to 75 carry 1 mark each) \n \nIn each of questions 26 to 50, fill each gap with the most \nappropriate option from the list provided. \n \n26. \u2026(A. In spite of B. Given C. Barring D. In case of) any \nproblems, I shall travel to London tomorrow on a business \ntrip.",
