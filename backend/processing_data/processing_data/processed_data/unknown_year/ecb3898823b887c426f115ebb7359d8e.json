Africans are infested with all kinds of \nproblem \nRead the following passage and answer \nthe questions that follow. \n \nReturning home after a decade and half \nabroad, our Geography master remained \nincurably addicted to foreign ways and ideas \nfor years after landing here. He would forever \nstick to his theory of Africans suffering from a \ncurse inflicted on them by the Almighty God for \nsome heinous sins committed centuries ago. He \nwould, in support of this theory, ask listeners: \n\"Why would our mosquito inflict deadly malaria \non us whereas the British mosquito does not \nbite? Why aren't there poisonous snakes in \nBritain whereas here most snakes are deadly? \nWhy should the deadly sickle cell disease be \npeculiar to the black race?\" \nOf course, he hardly waits for answers to \nthese and similar questions before jumping to \nthe same inevitable conclusion. However, he \nmet his match one day when a new student \njoined the class and heard the litany we were \nused to. The new boy calmly said, \"Sir, I \nhappen to know a few white men who suffer \nfrom the sickle cell disease; some are Italians \nand some are Spanish. The mosquito is equally \ndeadly in India, South-east Asian Countries and \nSouth America. The United States and some \nother South American 5 Countries have their \ndeadly snakes. And, Sir, I know many white \nmen, some of them British, who would prefer \nour brilliant sunshine to their horribly cold \nwinter.\" And he sat down. \nI had never, before that day, seen our \nmaster so consumed with anger. He directed a \nburning look at the poor boy, who had no \nanswer to this new battle. Without as much as \nsaying a single word, the master stalked out of \nthe classroom. Needless to say, our anger was \nturned on the new boy, who had decided to \nrock the boat without taking the time to sound \nthe water. A delegation was sent to the master \nto apologise to him. He was appeased. But we \nall noticed something rather unusual thereafter \nnever again did he dwell on the issue of \nAfricans being the cursed People. \nB.
