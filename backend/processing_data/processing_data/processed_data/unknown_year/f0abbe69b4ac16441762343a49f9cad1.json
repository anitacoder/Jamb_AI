Each question carries 3 marks. \n \nPASSAGE I \nIf present trends continue, the world would face a major \ncrisis by the end of this century: insufficient cheap, convenient \nenergy. For without such energy, industrial production will fall, \nagricultural output will drop, transport will be restricted and \nstandard of living in developed countries will plummet . At \npresent, almost all our energy comes from fossil fuels. The earth\u2019s \nreserves of fossil fuels have been formed from organic matter \nsubjected to enormous heat and pressure for millions of years. \nBut such reserves are finite. Because power demand is increasing \nvery rapidly, fossil fuels will be exhausted within a relatively \nshort time. We can estimate the amount of recoverable fuel under \nthe surface of the earth and we know the rate at which it is being \nextracted. Fairly simple calculations can therefore determine its \nremaining life. If present trends continue, gas and oil reserves \nwill be exhausted by the middle of the 21st century \u2013 about 70 \nyears from now. Similar estimates for coal and wood reserves \nsuggest a projected supply of 250-300 years. Of course, long \nbefore fossil fuels are exhausted, demand will greatly exceed \nsupply. \nFor too many years, the world has consumed fossil \nfuels with little thought for the future. In fact, world energy \nconsumption increased almost 600% between 1900 and 1965 \nand it is projected to increase by another 450% between 1965 \nand the year 2000. Crude oil has been pumped out of the ground \nfor about 100 years, but over half of it has been consumed in the \npast 18 years. Coal has been mined for over 800 years, but over \na half of it has been extracted in the past 37 years. In sum, most \nof the world\u2019s consumption of energy from fossil fuels \nthroughout history, has taken place within living memory. \n1. From the writer\u2019s description of the world energy situation, \nwe may conclude that \nA. developing nations will soon experience poverty \nB. demand for recoverable fuel will plummet \nC. consumption has not affected production \nD. decline has not affected demand. \n2. The writer seems to suggest that developed nations should \nA. always calculate a fossil fuel\u2019s remaining life \nB. reduce industrial and agricultural production",
