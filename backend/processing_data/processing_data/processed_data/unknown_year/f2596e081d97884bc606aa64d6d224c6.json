The question carries 3 marks \nThe African moralist has always regarded \nsmoking as an indication of moral degradation. \nA number of people have accepted the moralist \nidea on smoking while a good many people \nhave remained indifferent to the moralist view \nand have continued to smoke. The same \nargument has been applied to the consumption \nof alcohol. The African moralist, basing his \njudgement on the behaviour of a few \nalcoholics, tend to regard the habit of taking \nalcohol as a sign of wretchedness. The moralist \nholds the view that anybody who forms the \nhabit of consuming alcohol will never do well in \nlife. While this may be true in respect of a few \npeople in the society, the fear of the moralist \nhas not been justified. \nHowever, the economist is primarily interested \nin the habit of smoking and the consumption of \nalcohol in so far as they give satisfaction to \nsmokers and drinkers and so generate supply \nof and demand for tobacco and alcohol. \nSome moral principles associated with religion \ntend to lead on to economic problems. \nFollowers of certain religions are expected not \nto consume pork, take alcohol or smoke \ntobacco. Devotees of some religious groups, on \nthe other hand, can eat pork while others are \nexpected to abstain from alcohol and smoking. \nStrict observance of these moral rules could \ncripple the breweries, the cigarette factories \nand some businesses; however, there seems to \nbe a growing number of alcohol consumers and \ncigarette smokers-a development which should \nbe of interest to the economist. \nAdapted from Peter Scott's article in Sunday Times. \n \n1. The view expressed by the writer in the last \nparagraph is that (a) the number of alcoholics \nand smoker is certainly increasing (b) more \npeople appear to take to drinking and smoking \n(c) sales of alcohol and tobacco products have \nimproved tremendously (d) more people now \nabstain from drinking and smoking \n2. It can be concluded from the passage that \nmorality, religion and economy are (a) \nsomewhat interconnected (b) clearly \ninterconnected (c) certainly different (d) \ncertainly unrelated \n3. According to the passage, the moralist idea \nis that (a) the smoking of cigarettes is bad and \nunacceptable (b)it is typically African not to \nsmoke cigarettes (c) people sh6uld accept a \npoint of view only when they are convinced (d) \nsmoking is not good but a little alcohol may be \npermitted \n4. Which of the following statements is true \naccording to the passage? (a) total abstinence \nfrom drinking and smoking is a religious \nobligation (b)smoking and drinking may have \npositive effects on the economy (c) every one \nignores the moralist view on drinking and \nsmoking (d) people who drink or smoke surely \ndie of cancer \n5. The positions maintained by the moralist \nand the economist can be described as being \n(a) quite indifferent (b) very agreeable (c) very \npassionate (d) at variance \nPASSAGE ll \n \nRead the passage carefully and answer \nthe question that follows. The question \ncarries 3 marks \nWhen man evolved a conscience, his basic \nrelationship with the other animals began to \nchange. Until then, they were broadly divided \ninto those which ate him when they got the \nchance, those which he ate when he got the \nchance, and a third group which competed with \nhim for food, or was otherwise a nuisance to",
