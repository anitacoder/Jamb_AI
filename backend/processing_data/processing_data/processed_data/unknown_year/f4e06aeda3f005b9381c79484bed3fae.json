They could \nhardly notice the land getting brown all over Kachawanga again, \nsince neither of them hardly noticed any more the sun come up \nand go down. Ntanya would work very hard in the field hauling \nin the last harvest and Teresa would stay at home washing, \ncooking and waiting, waiting for him to come home. She would \ncook his meal with extra care and when there was little meat she \nwould only give bits to the children and not even touch it herself \nbut use only the smell to get her food down and reserve the \nwhole chunk for her husband. When Ntanya would come home \nwith sweat on his brows she would put the wooden tray on a \nstool for him and sit down by him watching him eat with great \nsatisfaction: every bolus that went down ntanya\u2019s throat would \nalso go down her own throat. When Ntanya would insist on \nsharing the food with her she would always say she had eaten \nalready no matter how hungry she might be. Ntanya would then \neat and drink to his satisfaction and always rest a while in the \nsun after saying \u2018Thank you mother\u2019. \n(Taken from Peter K.

For without Mathematics the engineer is but \nan artist or a scultptor. He can build his bridge, attest ot its form \nand beauty, but without Mathematics he cannot guarantee its \nreliability to serve the purpose for which it is built. Mathematics \nis indeed the science of sciences. It is also art of all arts. It is \nright, legitimate and defensible to consider Mathematics as an \nArt. The poet, the musician, the artist and the mathematician \nhave a lot in common. Fundamental to all their studies and works \nis their common interest in the logical study of related concepts \nand objects to form patterns which will produce beauty, harmony \nand logical order. Thus the poet arranges words to produce a \npattern called poetry: the musician arranges sounds to produce \na pattern called music: the artist arranges colours to produce a \npattern called painting and the mathematician arranges abstract \nideas into a pattern, using symbols, to produce equations. Each \nof these patterns - the poem, the music, the painting and the \nequation must stand up to the test of some order, harmony and \nbeauty. So if Mathematics is not an art what is art? \n \n11. The views expressed in this passage belong to \nA. JAMB B. artists C. mathematicians D. the poet \nE. the author of the passage. \n \n12. The expression \u2018Mathematics is the queen of the \nSciences\u2019 contians \nA. a contradiction B.  an analogy C. an irony \nD.  a lie E. nonsense \n \n13. \u2018Mathematics\u2019 iswritten with acapital Min this passage because \nA. the writer is a mathematician \nB. the writer does not know how to use punctuation correctly \nC. the writer wants to distinguish between a concept \nand a subject \nD. it is the normal way of writing about the sciences \nE. the writer is confused. \n \n14. The last sentence of the passage , \u2018So if Mathematics \nis not an art what is art?\u2019 is a \nA. questions posed for the reader to answer \nB. statement put in the form of a question \nC. question combined with a statement \nD. mathematical equation stated in words \nE. pattern which illustrates beauty, harmony and order \nin language. \n \n15. Mathematics can be considered as a form of art because \nA. its main principle is made use of by the arts \nB. it involves drawing of figures \nC. it is a form of Fine Arts",
