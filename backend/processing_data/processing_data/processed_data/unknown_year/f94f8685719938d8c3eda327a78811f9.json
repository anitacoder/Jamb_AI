Instead of doing this govern\nment should empower tertiary institutions \nin the conduct of local matriculation examinations.\n \n \nJAMB\n \nshould\n \nalso take urgent steps to reinvigorate credibility and integrity in its \nexaminations by checkmating examination malpractices. It is quite evident that giant \nstrides have been made in this direction. The ban placed on 100 CBT centres, discussed \nelsewh\nere in\n \nthis paper, is a good cas\ne in point. However, more could still be done in this \ndirection\n \nand all stakeholders in the education sector should come to the assistance of the \nBoard to so\nlve this multi\n-\nfacetted problem \nnot only\n \nof\n \nJAMB but of the whole nation \nas a \nwhole.\n \n \nGovernment is apparently in a \ndilemma\n \namidst calls for the un\n-\nbundling of JAMB. The \nreason is not far\n-\nfetched as the body language of the North does not favour such a \ndramatic step. \nThe apprehension is quite under\nsta\nnda\nble in view of the yawni\nng gap \nbetween the North and the South in the area of population of youths in higher institutions \nof learning. This problem could be solved from the primary and \nsecondary\n \nschools levels. \nThe preponderance of out of school children is higher in the North \nvi\ns\n-\n\u00e0\n-\nvis\n \nthe South. If \nthe gap would be bridged at the top, the best place to start is from the lower levels. \n \n \nReferences\n \n \nAgbama, D. (2019)\n.\n \nThe history of examinations in Nige\nria.
